<p class="h2a">THE TRAGEDY IN THE SHAFT</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;WHERE'S the cage?&quot; asked Steve
Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess it's waiting for a load
at the surface,&quot; answered Bob Jarvis, listening
at the shaft opening. &quot;I don't hear it coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ring it down, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Young Jarvis gave the bell lever a pull. A
second later the gong on that level rang sharply.
A rush of air told them the steel cage was on
its way down to the fifteenth level, where the
young men were awaiting it. With a noisy clatter
the cage came to a stop at the opening on
that level; the iron guard bars fell back with
a bang.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All aboard,&quot; said Steve, standing aside that
the five other men, all miners, waiting to be
conveyed to the surface might step into the
damp cage.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
&quot;You first,&quot; bowed Jarvis with mock politeness,
waving Steve in ahead of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give them the signal, Bob,&quot; ordered Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang! Five
strokes rang out on the gong at the top of the
shaft leading down into the mine, indicating
to the cage-tender of the Red Rock Mine that
his cage was coming up with a load of human
freight. In other words, there were men on
the cage, hence the steel elevator was to be raised
with care.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly, but steadily, gaining in speed as it
ascended, lighted only by the faint glimmer of
the tallow candles on the oilskin hats of the occupants,
the cage rose toward the surface.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis had been inspecting
the tracks in the Red Rock Mine and were
now on their way to the surface for the purpose
of going down in the Cousin Jack Mine, there
to continue their work of inspection. A few
seconds had passed when the cage began to sway
from side to side.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve instinctively reached up and took hold
of the safety rod that extended across the top
of the cage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang on, Bob! We're going altogether too
fast for comfort,&quot; warned Rush. &quot;What ails
that engineer up there? It looks as though he
were trying to give us a shaking up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
&quot;I'll shake him up when I get to the top,&quot;
answered Bob with a growl, as he grasped the
rod over his head for support.</p>

<p class="indent">The others on the car, all foreigners, were
standing stolidly, not appearing to care one way
or the other what happened. They were too
used to riding up and down in the cage to and
from their daily work to be greatly disturbed
by the rough ride they were now taking.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve, however, knew full well that they were
riding altogether too fast for safety. He was
not afraid; his nerves were too steady for that.
Nor was his companion, Bob Jarvis, the least
bit worried, but he was growling at the cage-tender
far above them for his roughness.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly there came a sound that startled all
hands. It was a quick, crunching, grinding
sound, followed by crash after crash of metal
meeting metal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold fast,&quot; shouted Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's happened, Steve?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The car's off the track! Look out everybody!
We're in for trouble now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No sooner had he spoken than the steel floor
beneath their feet seemed to slip suddenly
from under them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's turning turtle!&quot; cried Steve. &quot;Hold
fast!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His warning had come too late. The miners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
had been thrown from their feet to the floor
of the cage. With quick instinct Steve; gripping
the iron bar over his head, stretched his
legs down full length. Bob's grip had been
wrenched from the safety bar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grab my feet, Bob!&quot; Steve shouted at the
top of his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob Jarvis was a quick-witted boy as well.
He fastened a firm grip on the ankles of his
companion just as the floor of the cage began
slipping from under him.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the stolid foreigners were fully
awake to the peril that confronted them. With
cries that neither lad ever forgot, the men
slipped from the cage that had turned turtle,
plunging into the dark abyss, that quickly swallowed
them up. There was one of the five
miners, however, more quick of wit than his
companions, who had also fastened to Steve's
ankles. He and Bob Jarvis found themselves
dangling in space while Steve, clinging to the
iron cross bar above, was holding them up.</p>

<p class="indent">The two men were very much in each other's
way, and the miner was fighting desperately to
push Jarvis away down into the shaft.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quit that, you cowardly cur!&quot; commanded
the lad. &quot;You'll have the three of us down
if you don't look sharp. Steve, are you all
right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
&quot;Yes, but be careful down there. Whom have
you with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. He's a heathen&mdash;that's all
I know about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me&mdash;me Dominick. Me&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you're the loafer who tried to knife Steve
that time when he saved you from being blown
to the moon by dynamite? I ought to drop you,
and I'll do it as sure as my name's Bob Jarvis
if you don't stop your fighting. Steve, can you
hold us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid not for long,&quot; answered the
plucky lad, who was supporting the two men
by the sheer strength of his arms. &quot;My arms
are aching like a sore tooth, but I'll hold on till
they come off. Don't make any more disturbance
down there than you can help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob groaned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll never make it. You can't hold on
and bear our weight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve's arms were growing numb. Fortunately
he was possessed of great strength, and
his present position was something like that of
a bar performer's when about to attempt a giant
swing. Had it not been for the great weight
that he was supporting Steve could have held
on indefinitely. As it was, he could not hope to
cling to the bar much longer. The lad's mind
was working rapidly. He was trying to plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
some way out of the predicament, some way
that would save the lives of all three.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steve!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can't all be saved. It's out of the question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang on, old boy! They will send us help
soon,&quot; answered Rush in an encouraging tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They can't send help in time to save us. I've
a proposition to make.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dominick and I must let go, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will do nothing of the sort!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must. It is the only way to save you.
If we don't, the three of us are lost. You can't
hold both of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve laughed harshly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you will have difficulty in convincing
Dominick that he must let go. He'll never let
go as long as he has my feet to hang to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll show you whether he will or not.
I'll&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bob!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve's tone was sharp and commanding.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang on, both of you! I, too, have a plan
to suggest. I don't know whether we can get
away with it or not, but we will try. You
must move very carefully, for I am getting
tired.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
&quot;What's your plan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One of you climb up my body. I can't help
you. You will have to accomplish it the best
way you can. If you can get up beside me on
the bar here, you ought to be able to hold on.
It is our only hope. Otherwise we shall be
dashed to death at the bottom of the shaft.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll try it. Dominick, do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then see that you do as you are told. You
go first. Tell him what to do, Steve.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Climb very carefully. Don't hurry or make
any sudden moves. If you do, you will jerk
me loose from the bar here. Be as quick as you
can without fumbling. Dominick, you swing
to my left leg, Bob holding to the other. Be
careful that you don't drop off when you make
the change. There, that's a relief,&quot; added Steve
when they had made the change as directed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are ready,&quot; announced Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along, Dominick. That's right; you
are doing well. When you get up a little further
hook one hand into my belt and rest a minute.
You will be all right in a few minutes. Gracious,
my arms are getting tired!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Italian had begun to climb up the Iron
Boy's leg, creeping inch by inch, breathing hard,
the man's eyes fairly starting from his head in
his terrible fear of the death that he knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
awaited him a thousand feet below. All the time
Steve's calm, steady voice was encouraging the
man, directing him and urging him on to renewed
efforts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurry up,&quot; called Jarvis. &quot;I'll be letting
go myself, first thing you fellows know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you are. Grab the bar,&quot; commanded
Steve sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">With an exclamation that was almost a shout
of joy, the Italian fastened both hands over the
iron bar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you hang on there for a few minutes?&quot;
questioned Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me hang&mdash;me hold fast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's right. I will relieve you in a minute.
Now, Bob, it is your turn. Can you climb up
here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Watch me. Can you hold on, Steve?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the rest of the day. You are a featherweight
compared with the weight I have been
holding up. But hurry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jarvis began to climb, moving cautiously,
throwing as little strain on the arms of Steve
Rush as was possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're doing well. Come along,&quot; urged
Steve. &quot;This is like building a human pyramid
the way we used to do it at high school. Have
you got the bar?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right you are. Hooray!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Steve Rush breathed a deep sigh of relief.
He knew that he could have held on but a few
minutes longer. His arms were at the point of
giving out when the Italian had begun to climb.
But now he felt that they were all safe for the
moment, though there was only a slender iron
bar between them and destruction at the bottom
of the shaft.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, what are we going to do&mdash;hang here
all the rest of the day?&quot; demanded Bob Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; we shall not be able to do that. I'm
going to save Dominick if you will help me.
Both of you move over as close to the ends of
the bar as possible; then I will tell you what I
want to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dominick and Bob did as directed, edging
along the iron bar inch by inch. Steve's candle
was burning dimly, the others having gone out;
but the single candle lighted up the scene so that
they could see what they were about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now listen to what I have to say,&quot; directed
Rush with as much calmness as if he were managing
a piece of work above ground.</p>

<p class="indent">In Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis the reader has
no doubt ere this recognized the Iron Boys, the
lads who, as told in &quot;<span class="smcap">The Iron Boys in the
Mines</span>,&quot; began their career in the industrial
world by joining the army of workers underground,
deep down in the Cousin Jack Iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
Mine. It will be recalled how the friendship
of the two sturdy boys began with their battle
in the lonely drift, where Steve, though of somewhat
slighter build than the other, not only held
his own, but gave Bob Jarvis the roughest
handling he had ever received. Almost from
the beginning the lads had attracted the attention
of their superiors by their attention to
duty, their intelligent work and their honesty.
It will be remembered how Steve and Bob invented
a new gravity system for the mine, by
which many thousands of dollars were saved for
the mining company; how the lads saved the
officials of the company from being blown up by
dynamite and how in the end they were rewarded
by the officers for their bravery.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush and Jarvis were still inspectors of the
trackage in the mine. The second mine of the
group had been added, so that now they were
in charge of the tracks in both the Cousin Jack
and the Red Rock Mines. Beyond this there
had been a rumor that the Iron Boys were to receive
further promotions. A clerk in the office
had whispered this to the boarding-house boss
where the boys lived. As yet the boys knew
nothing of the proposed promotion, and they
never would know unless they were quickly rescued
from the desperate situation into which
they had been so suddenly plunged.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
&quot;What is your plan now?&quot; questioned Jarvis.
&quot;I am listening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you to stay where you are, both of
you, for I shall shake the cage up a bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve began swaying his body back and forth
as if he were in reality about to essay the giant
swing. All at once he curled his legs up and
over the bar. There he hung for a moment,
then by sheer strength swung himself up astride
the bar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that's a stunt for certain,&quot; cried Bob,
for the moment lost in admiration of the feat he
had just witnessed. &quot;I'd like to see a circus
performer beat that, especially if he were hanging
over a thousand feet of nothingness, with
a couple of clumsy louts trying to pull him
down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is better,&quot; announced Rush, with a
mirthless grin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it must be fine, but what now? My
arms will be giving out pretty soon, and I
shouldn't be surprised if Dominick were getting
uneasy. How about it, Dominick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me all right,&quot; answered the Italian stolidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Move over here, Bob. Dominick, you stay
where you are. I will take care of you in a moment.
Now curl up your feet as you saw me do,
Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I couldn't do that to save my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
&quot;You will have to, if you expect to save it.
I know of no other way. Wait, I'll help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve leaned over, and, holding to the bar
with one hand, reached down, grabbing Bob
under one knee.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold fast! There you come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jarvis threw all his strength into the effort,
and after some clumsy moves landed unsteadily
beside Steve Rush on the iron bar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whew! I'd never have made it if it hadn't
been for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Dominick; we will have you up here
now,&quot; said Rush, with a laugh that was intended
to encourage his companions. &quot;This is just exercise.
No need to feel disturbed about it in
the least. Bob, you grab one leg and I will take
hold of the other. We will have him right side
up in no time at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dominick let out a yell as he felt himself being
torn loose from the bar. The Italian floundered.
Bob's grip slipped and Dominick dropped head
downward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's gone! Oh, what a fool I am!&quot; groaned
Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">But the Italian had not gone. Steve Rush
had twisted his own legs about the bar, allowing
himself to turn over until he was hanging head
downward, both hands gripping one foot of the
man Dominick. The latter was howling lustily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
&quot;Get hold of us, Bob,&quot; cried Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">Jarvis, suddenly recalled to his duty, began
edging along the rod until he had reached a
point where he was able to hold the Italian
until Steve righted himself.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a hard struggle, but after a few minutes
the two boys succeeded in rescuing their
companion and placing him beside them on the
iron bar. Dominick was trembling from head
to foot. He was so unnerved from his narrow
escape that for some moments he could not
speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brace up!&quot; commanded Steve, slapping the
man sharply on the cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">This brought the Italian around almost instantly.
He began chattering angrily in his own
language, and in his anger at the blow would
have struck Steve had he dared to take his hands
from the slender support long enough to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush laughed at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't lose your temper, Dominick. I was
only trying to brace you up. You are all right
now. Hang on until I get some of these guard
bars free. I'll have a support for all of us in
a moment. Sit perfectly still or you may jar
me off, even though you do not fall off yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the next few minutes the Iron Boy busied
himself wrenching loose the bars that fitted into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
the opening of the cage to prevent the passengers
from falling out. These he laid across the
bottom, securing them to the flanges of the cage.
They fitted snugly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; announced Steve, after completing
his task. &quot;This will be just as good as a solid
floor so long as neither of you moves about too
much and displaces them. Get over there,
Dominick. Now we are all right! They can
haul us up just as soon as they want to. I, for
one, shouldn't mind feeling something solid underneath
me for a change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No such luck!&quot; growled Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">A slight jolt cut short their talk. The lads
listened, but heard nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something has gone wrong with the machinery,&quot;
said Steve in a low tone. &quot;I shouldn't
be surprised if we had to stay here for a long
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, the cage is moving!&quot; cried Bob excitedly.
&quot;Hooray, we're saved!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet,&quot; answered Steve, as the cage came
to a jarring stop after having moved upward a
few inches.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h2a">AN UNEXPECTED PROMOTION</p>

<p class="indent">THE hours dragged wearily along, the
cage resting motionless, save for an occasional
jolt, in the dark shaft. Long
ago Steve Rush's candle had burned out, the
hot grease dripping down over his hat brim.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once, without the usual jarring warning,
the cage began to move slowly upward. Being
off the track, it bumped along not unlike a handcar
running on the ties of a railroad, banging
from side to side of the shaft, threatening every
instant to precipitate the three men to the bottom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang on, fellows!&quot; cried Steve. &quot;Watch
out that those guard rails do not jar loose. Keep
your hands on the ends, and at the first sign of
trouble get over on the iron rod.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The others did as he directed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You've got the only real head in the mines,&quot;
grumbled Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush did not answer. He was too busy looking
out for their safety to indulge in further
conversation. It was the longest and roughest
ride that any one of those three men ever had
experienced, and the way up through the shaft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
seemed many miles. At last a faint light filtered
down about the cage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are getting near the top,&quot; announced
Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve nodded, but did not reply. The light
grew stronger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit steady,&quot; warned Rush. &quot;Do not attempt
to leave the cage until I tell you, unless you want
to get a dandy tumble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then the cage was drawn out into the full
daylight, where it stopped. They heard excited
voices about them, then a face peered up under
the edge of the cage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, out there!&quot; called Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are men in the cage. They're alive!&quot;
cried a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; help us out,&quot; ordered Rush in a matter-of-fact
tone. &quot;Our quarters are somewhat
cramped.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shove some planking over the shaft,&quot; commanded
a voice that the boys recognized as belonging
to Superintendent Penton. &quot;Be quick
about it. Hello, in there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, sir,&quot; replied Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am Steve Rush.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; Bob Jarvis and Dominick are with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might have known it. Heaven be praised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
that you are safe. How many men were on the
car?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four besides ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did they fall?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; you will find them at the bottom of
the shaft,&quot; answered the boy sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">The shouting without quickly died away.
Planks were cast over the shaft opening, forming
a platform on which the men might drop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lower the cage a little,&quot; ordered the superintendent.</p>

<p class="indent">This was done. Steve was the first to leap
down to the platform, followed quickly by Bob
Jarvis, then by the Italian. The moment Dominick
felt the solid planking underneath his feet,
he uttered a yell and started on a run for home.
Mr. Penton shouted to him to halt, but Dominick
seemed deaf to all outward sounds. He was
hurrying home to tell his wife of his hairbreadth
escape from death.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime Mr. Penton had sprung
forward, grasping the hands of the Iron Boys,
which he wrung heartily, the tears almost blinding
his sight, for he had grown to be very fond
of these two manly young fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, sir,&quot; said Steve, &quot;but
have you had those poor fellows who fell in
looked up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have just sent a rescue party to the lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
level to look for them. I had not been here ten
minutes when you came up. Nothing was being
done. Everyone seemed to have lost his
head&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One man didn't,&quot; interrupted Bob Jarvis
grimly. &quot;Steve Rush didn't, or three of us
would have been down there now, smashed
flat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You two may go home, if you wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For what, sir?&quot; asked Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your nerves no doubt are a little shaken,
and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our nerves are all right, sir. Besides, we
may be needed here. I think we had better go
down on one of the skips and see if we can be
of any service to the men who fell&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then the superintendent was called to the
telephone by the side of the shaft. He returned
after giving some brief directions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's all over, boys,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have they found them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. The men are dead. It could not have
been otherwise after that terrible fall. They
are sending the bodies up on a skip. I shall
be busy here for the next hour. If you will meet
me at my office, at the end of the hour, I shall
be there. I want to say something to you both.
I had intended seeing you some time to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;Very well, sir,&quot; replied Steve. &quot;I don't
know that I want to stay here, unless there is
something that I can do to help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing,&quot; replied Mr. Penton.</p>

<p class="indent">The boys walked away, thoughtful and silent.
They had taken part in a grim tragedy, such as
was likely to happen at any time in the busy
mines. To-morrow it would be forgotten and
the work of burrowing under the earth would
go on just as though nothing out of the ordinary
had occurred.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a close call,&quot; said Bob, glancing into
the thoughtful face of his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor fellows,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Did they
leave families?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will find out. Perhaps we may be able
to do something for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not long after the youths had reached the
office of the superintendent, Mr. Penton came in.
He shook hands with the boys again, after which
he called in the claim adjuster.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This affair will cost us something in damages,&quot;
Mr. Penton said. &quot;But the company will
pay willingly. Will you two boys make a statement,
giving the adjuster all the facts?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; answered Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dominick will not get over his fright before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
to-morrow, and even at that, his testimony
would not be of much value to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a stenographer had been summoned,
Steve related in a concise manner the story of
the accident to the cage, not neglecting to mention
the speed at which the car was traveling
when the cage turned turtle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you anything to add to that, Jarvis?&quot;
asked Mr. Penton after Steve had concluded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a word. I couldn't have told it better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton did not smile. He regarded Rush
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the clearest and most comprehensive
statement of an accident that I have ever listened
to, Steve. After it has been transcribed I shall
ask both of you to sign it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This the boys did, swearing to the truth of
the statement they had made. The claim adjuster
then thanked them and left the room. It
was a clear case against the company, for there
had been neglect on the part of some employé.
The accident would cost the company thousands
of dollars, but to the credit of the company
there was to be no effort to evade responsibility.</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boys rose to leave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down,&quot; said Mr. Penton, motioning them
back to their chairs. &quot;As I told you over at the
shaft, I desire to talk with you. How long have
you been in the mines?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
&quot;I have been here a year. Jarvis has been
here a little longer than that,&quot; answered Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just so. In that time you two have proved
yourselves out. You have done well all that
has been given to you to do, and you have gone
somewhat beyond that, I may add,&quot; said Mr.
Penton, with a smile. &quot;I want to ask you a
personal question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it your intention to remain in the mines
permanently?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve thought a moment before replying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have thought that I should like to familiarize
myself with the entire iron and steel business.
After I have learned all I can in the
mines, I think I should like to go on&mdash;to go
further&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The mills, for instance&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob Jarvis nodded his approval of what
Steve had said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I rather thought so. While I shall not want
to lose you, you may rest assured that I shall
leave nothing undone to push you along. You
have a career before you, each of you. The keynote
of success in the industrial world is patriotism.
There is patriotism for flag and country
and there is another kind as well&mdash;patriotism
of achievement. It is this patriotism which accomplishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
great works in the industrial world.
Without it our great industries could not exist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir; I feel it, sir,&quot; said Steve brightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. I have known it for a long
time. It is such patriotism as yours that accomplishes
results in the world. The president
of the company is aware that you possess it.
I had a letter from him yesterday regarding you
boys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton turned over the papers on his
desk. Selecting the letter he was in search of,
he read it, then laid the paper back on his desk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Carrhart, the president, is deeply interested
in you. This letter is in reference to you,
making certain suggestions. Have you any idea
what they are?&quot; laughed the superintendent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope he isn't going to discharge us,&quot; interjected
Bob Jarvis whimsically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not quite so bad as that,&quot; answered Mr.
Penton, laughing softly. &quot;He does, however, request
me to relieve you of your present duties.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob's face fell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But this is in order to give you something
better. I am ordered to promote you to the
grade of foremen. How does that strike you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Knocks me clear over,&quot; answered Jarvis
promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Promoted to the grade of foremen?&quot; repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Steve, scarcely able to believe that what
he had heard was not a mistake.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Something more than that. You are
to be general foremen&mdash;shift bosses. The ordinary
foreman, as you know, has charge of the
shift in one drift only. You boys will have several
drifts under your charge. You have had
sufficient experience so that I think you will
have no difficulty in handling the work. The
more ore you get out the better the company
will be satisfied. What the company wants is
results. The man who can give them results
is the man that the company wants to promote
to higher positions. You have done well in this
direction already. I shall expect you to continue
to advance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are very kind. We shall do the best
we can, but it is a responsible position for a
boy,&quot; replied Steve thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For a mere boy, yes. I look upon you two
lads as men. You have proved up to the mark,
and you have done the work, assuming the responsibilities
of full-grown men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What pay do we get?&quot; questioned Bob
Jarvis, with an eye to business.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a business-like question. I was wondering
if you were going to ask that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I am, sir. I wish to know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
&quot;I will tell you. You will receive, beginning
with the first of the coming week, one hundred
and twenty-five dollars each per month. You
should be able to lay up some money out of
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed we shall,&quot; answered Steve. &quot;It is
a fine salary, but I shall do my best to earn
it, as I know Bob will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jarvis nodded more emphatically than ever.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h2a">STEVE SHOWS THE IRON HAND</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;TELL the mine captain that I wish to see
him,&quot; said Steve Rush to one of the
men working in his shift.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what I am sending you to find out,&quot;
answered the young foreman, somewhat sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">The messenger hurried away, grumbling to
himself. While the Iron Boys were popular in
the mines, there had been no little grumbling
when it was learned that they had been promoted
over men who had spent many years in the mines.
Steve knew and understood this, but he knew
that he had done no one an injustice. He had
worked hard, and if his employers considered
that he was entitled to promotion that was his
own good fortune.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One seldom gets anything in this world unless
he works for it and earns it,&quot; was the lad's
wise conclusion on this particular morning, as
his keen eyes caught a disgruntled look on the
face of more than one man working under him.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve, true to his name, was pushing the work
of his employers with his characteristic rushing
tactics. Upon taking up the new work he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
made a brief speech to each shift in his department.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men,&quot; he said, &quot;I am younger than most of
you, but you may depend upon one thing. I
shall always treat you with absolute fairness
and do you justice. If at any time you think
such is not the case, tell me so, or go to the superintendent.
If I fail in my duty toward you, at
any time, it will be because I do not know
better, and under such circumstances I shall be
glad to be enlightened. However, the business
of the mining company comes first. Everything
must give way before that. Our sole business
in life, down here, is to get out iron ore. I am
satisfied that this drift has not been getting out
nearly as much as it should. I shall hereafter
expect at least two more tons a day than you
have been mining. If you find that you cannot
do it, you will have to give me a good excuse.
The ore is running soft. You'll never have
easier work than what is before you now. Take
some pride in your work. See if you can't beat
them all. If you break records I shall see to
it that those higher up are informed of it. That
is all I have to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A similar speech was made by Rush to each
of the dozen drift crews under his command.
Either his words, or the manner in which he
spoke them took hold of the men, for the output
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
of the twelve drifts was increased by twelve tons
the first day.</p>

<p class="indent">Superintendent Penton rubbed his eyes when
the report came in to him that night. He wondered
if a mistake had not been made. On
the report of the ore mined in Bob Jarvis' department
he found a substantial increase also,
though not within half a dozen tons of that
shown by Steve Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton said nothing, but decided to wait
until the week was over, when, if the increase
held up to the mark set, he would call the attention
of the Duluth officials to the gain. He
knew this would please Mr. Carrhart, for the
president had great confidence in Rush, and in
his rough and ready companion, Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">Both boys were stationed on the twentieth
level, far down in the earth in the Red Rock
Mine, to which they had been transferred with
their promotion. That morning Steve had been
making an inspection of the various drifts. It
was the first opportunity he had had to make a
thorough examination of them. In section
twenty-four L he had made a discovery that led
him to send for the mine captain at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything gone wrong?&quot; demanded the mine
captain, strolling in half an hour later.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but there is likely to be. Come in here.
I want to show you something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Steve led the way into the drift, where the
diamond drills were banging away in a deafening
chorus. He motioned for the men to shut
off the drills; then, climbing up on the crumbling
ore that was being shoveled into the tram
cars, he held his candle up to the peak of the
dome-like drift.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see that?&quot; demanded Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see anything very alarming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don't?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush pointed to a seam in the rocks overhead.
The seam extended along through some three
feet of rock and ore. There was a narrow opening
or crack there into which the lad jabbed his
sharp-pointed candlestick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now do you see what I am trying to show
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw! That's nothing. We always get
those cracks in back-stoping.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are not back-stoping now; we're drifting,&quot;
protested Steve. &quot;That drift is dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No more so than any of them. This isn't a
kid's job; it's a man's job down in these
mines.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am simply pointing it out to you, sir. At
the same time I want to ask your permission
either to abandon the drift until it can be shored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
up, or to back-stope until we can get through to
solid rock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on with your drifting. We can't stop
for a little thing like that, I tell you,&quot; answered
the mine captain, turning and starting away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pull out your drills,&quot; commanded Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">The drill-men began to obey his command.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shovelers and trammers knock off. Hand in
your time until I can see the superintendent and
get you in a new place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mine captain came striding back. He had
overheard the orders of the young foreman, and
the captain's face reflected his anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here, what are you doing?&quot; he demanded
sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am closing this drift for the present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I order your men back to work. What do
you mean by interfering with the work of this
shift?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I already have told you what I mean, sir.
I decline to risk the lives of the men in section
twenty-four L until it has been made safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get back to work, every man of you, unless
you want to be fired out of this mine!&quot; commanded
the captain.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve raised a warning hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men, I am your foreman. You will obey me.
Mr. Mine Captain, you have no right to give
these men orders over my head. I have asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
you for protection for them. You refuse to
give it. I am responsible for their safety, so all
work will stop in this drift, so far as I am concerned,
until you have made the drift safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll report you; I'll put another crew to
work. I'll&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I'll report you if you do. I have no
intention of being disrespectful, and I am willing
to take the responsibility for my act.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With this Steve urged his men out of the drift.
The captain fumed, but he knew full well that
Steve was right in saying that he had no right
to order the men back to work.</p>

<p class="indent">No sooner had the men of the regular shift
withdrawn and gone up to the surface, than the
mine captain gathered another crew and set them
to work in section twenty-four L, Steve in the
meantime having gone to another part of the
works. The captain did not want the daily output
to fall behind, for that would reflect on him.
The captain set the new shift at work, then went
away about his business, muttering his threats
against the young foreman.</p>

<p class="indent">When Steve passed that way again his attention
was attracted by a light in the drift.
Somewhat surprised, he turned into section
twenty-four L to learn what was going on in
there. He found a new crew at work.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who sent you in here?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
&quot;The captain did,&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well; so long as he has done so it is
not for me to order you out. You do not belong
to my crew. But let me warn you, men. This
drift is not safe. Some or all of you are likely
to get hurt. I should advise against your working
here. I have sent my crew away and they
will not come into the drift until something has
been done to make it safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The miners laughed and went on with their
work. The drill-men were boring in, making
openings for the dynamite sticks, while the trammers
were loading, taking their time at the work.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve turned away when he saw that the men
did not take his warning seriously. He made his
way to the telephone, where he called up Superintendent
Penton, acquainting him with conditions
in section twenty-four L.</p>

<p class="indent">The superintendent said he would be down as
soon as he could get into his mine clothes. He
directed Steve to leave matters as they were
until he could look into the affair. At the same
time Mr. Penton warned Steve that these disagreements
between mine captain and foremen
were very bad for the discipline of the mine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am willing to assume the full responsibility
for my act, sir,&quot; was the answer of the young
foreman, as he hung up the receiver and started
away, his lips shut tightly together, a look of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
stubborn determination on his face. Steve was
ready to give or take.</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly after that Mr. Penton arrived. He
looked up the mine captain first, and heard what
the latter had to say. Then the two men sought
out Steve Rush, whom they found directing the
work of one of his crews.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush, this is a bad piece of business. What
have you to say for yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing more to say, sir, so far
as I am concerned. It is for you to decide
whether I am in the right or the wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say the drift is not safe for the men
to work in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The mine captain disagrees with you, and
you have had an argument with him before the
men. Rush, I am surprised at you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve's face flushed a dull red, but he held his
head erect, looking the superintendent squarely
in the eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am willing to assume all the responsibility
for my act. One of the first lessons I learned
from you, sir, was to guard the lives of the men
as I would my own. I do not think there was
need for me to learn the lesson. I should have
done it anyway. The drift is in a dangerous
condition. No men under my charge shall work
there in its present condition. If you say they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
are to do so I shall step down and out. I do
not want to feel, after an accident has occurred,
that I am responsible for the maiming of a lot
of men, not to mention the possible loss of life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's what comes from giving a kid authority,&quot;
nodded the mine captain.</p>

<p class="indent">The superintendent raised a restraining hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will have a look at the drift. You may
come with us, Rush.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The three started away, Steve walking on
ahead, the superintendent and mine captain
bringing up the rear. They had gone something
more than half way through the cross-cut when
they saw a miner approaching them on the run.
Steve saw at once that something had gone
wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's the matter?&quot; he cried before the man
got up to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty-four L has caved in, burying the
whole crew!&quot; panted the messenger. &quot;There's
tons of red ore and rock on them. They're wiped
clean off the slate!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h2a">MYSTERY IN THE AIR</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;RUSH, I owe you an apology. Had we
listened to you, the company would
have saved several thousands of dollars
in damages that they will now have to pay,&quot;
said the superintendent.</p>

<p class="indent">This conversation took place on the day following
the accident in section twenty-four L.
It had been a serious affair. The entire dome
of the drift had caved in, starting from a crack
in the rocks which the Iron Boy had pronounced
dangerous. At the time of the cave-in, the drill-man
had been operating the diamond drill. The
vibration had loosened the rocks and the whole
roof had collapsed. The drill-man and his assistant
had been killed, and nearly every other
man in the drift at the time had been injured.</p>

<p class="indent">The unfortunate miners were quickly dug out,
Steve Rush working in the dangerous drift at
the imminent risk of losing his own life, with
rock and ore showering about him almost every
second of the time. For a time it was feared
that the whole length of the tunnel would cave
in, but under the direction of the superintendent
fresh pillars and lagging were quickly set in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
place, saving the mine from more serious disaster.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid,&quot; continued Mr. Penton, &quot;that
the mine captain in the Red Rock will be reduced
to the ranks, or dropped altogether as
the result of this. It is a matter that the president
will have to decide.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry, sir, if I have been the cause of
trouble for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cause? Why, if he had followed your advice
the disaster would not have occurred. I
have made a report of the entire matter, giving
you full credit. I also want to ask if you have
inspected the other drifts in your shift.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you consider them safe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir. Of course, a crack is likely to develop
at any time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. But you must keep close watch
on them. I have had every foreman make a
careful inspection and report on the condition
of the various works. Each foreman, hereafter,
is to be held personally responsible for the
safety of his works, so far as man can guard
against accidents.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad of that, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the same time I wish to congratulate you
on the increased production of your section. It
is an object lesson for the rest of the mine. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
don't imagine the other foremen are pleased
with the pace you have set for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The end of the noon hour was at hand, so Rush
hurried back and descended in the cage to the
level where he was to work. Later in the afternoon
he and Bob Jarvis met, their sections adjoining,
thus enabling them to have frequent
conversations during the day.</p>

<p class="indent">For a time they discussed the accident of the
previous day, Steve giving his companion advice
about watching the condition of the drifts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a dangerous mine at best, and I
shouldn't be surprised if we had a really
serious accident one of these days,&quot; said Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It strikes me that we have had one already,&quot;
replied Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it was bad enough. I am not an engineer,
but I have eyes. In the first place, look
at the woodwork down here. Why, it's as dry
as powder. It is different from the Cousin Jack
Mine, where everything is damp or wet. Just
look at these piles of chips and shavings. I am
surprised that the officers of the company will
stand for such a condition of affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's an old mine,&quot; suggested Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that is it. The mine has been worked
for twenty years and it will soon be abandoned.
I presume for that reason they do not wish
to spend any more money on it than is actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
necessary. The roofs of the levels are pretty
well shored up, but they are all settling. You
can see that without half looking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope we won't have any trouble while we
are working here,&quot; said Bob thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I. It is a hazardous calling that you
and I have chosen, old man. Between cave-ins,
dynamite explosions, falling cages and other
troubles we shall have to keep our eyes open.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and we have got a bad lot of men
about us,&quot; added Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The foreigners, you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, they are a choice lot of anarchists,&quot;
continued Steve. &quot;Many of them have leanings
in that direction. Between the Finns, the Huns
and the Italians the company has its hands full.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a pity they do not clean out that crowd.
These fellows will cause trouble some time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what I think. And, between you and
me, Bob, something is going on in these mines.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something is doing&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hadn't noticed it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven't you seen the men talking in little
groups, especially at the noon hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I have seen that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And have you noticed that, when a white
man approaches, they quickly disperse?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will confess that I hadn't attached any
special significance to it, but, now that you speak
of it, it does seem strange.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the way the matter strikes me. It
is none of our business, and yet it is. Some of
our men are in the scheme, whatever it may
be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to tell Mr. Penton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not now,&quot; replied Rush after brief reflection.
&quot;He will tire of our running to him
with every little thing. Besides, I give the
superintendent credit for at least ordinary
shrewdness. He undoubtedly knows what is
going on just as well as we do, and perhaps a
great deal better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think they are planning, if
anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a mystery to me, Bob, but I am going
to find out. I have a right to do that so far
as my own men are concerned, and so have you.
It is our duty to know what is going on in our
own sections.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why don't you ask the men outright?&quot;
demanded Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That would be a foolish thing to do. By
letting them think we have no suspicions we
shall learn what they are planning sooner or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
later. You don't suppose they would tell me if
I were to ask them, do you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I guess that's so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then keep your eyes open and I will do
the same. When we get anything definite, perhaps
we will go to Mr. Penton with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the plotting, or whatever it is, going on
over in the Cousin Jack, too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think so. I noticed it when I was over
there two days ago. It is curious to me that
the mining captains are not wise by this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This one never would discover anything.
Are they going to keep him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not know,&quot; answered Steve. &quot;Naturally
I have not asked. I am in rather a delicate
position, in view of the fact that I got the captain
into this difficulty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I must get back to my work. I think
it is safe to say that nothing will occur yet
a while, and perhaps not at all. But we shall
be on the job when it does, old man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Waving their hands in parting salute, the
young foremen turned and walked away to attend
to their duties. But, though they did not
apprehend any immediate trouble, they were
destined, within the next few days, to meet with
the most thrilling experiences of their lives&mdash;experiences
that they would never forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span></p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h2a">&quot;THE MINE IS ON FIRE&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">THREE days had passed uneventfully, the
Iron Boys having kept up their record
for mining more ore than any other section
in either of the company's mines. How
they succeeded in doing so was a mystery to
Mr. Penton, for he failed to discover that the
boys were applying any new methods to the
operation of their drifts.</p>

<p class="indent">At noon on the third day, when most of the
miners were eating their dinners in the mines,
the foremen and shift bosses having come to
the surface, Steve also had come up for the purpose
of going to his boarding place to get a
pair of boots.</p>

<p class="indent">The lad ate a quick dinner at the boarding
house, then hurried back toward the shaft. Bob
had remained in the mines, and Steve hoped to
be down in time to have a chat with his friend
before the whistles blew for the resumption of
work at a quarter after one o'clock. The Iron
Boy was walking rapidly, when all of a sudden
just about an eighth of a mile from the Red
Rock shaft, he saw a wisp of smoke shoot up
from the main shaft.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
Steve halted, fixing a keen glance on the dark
upper works of the towering shaft trestle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's curious,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I am sure
I saw smoke there. Perhaps it came from the
engine house yonder. But, no; the wind is in
the opposite direction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lad saw no further signs of smoke, so he
started on, half believing that he had been
wrong. He had gone but a short distance when
he halted suddenly, uttering an exclamation of
startled amazement at what he beheld.</p>

<p class="indent">A huge column of black smoke burst from the
shaft, shooting high in the air. When far above
the top of the shaft the column opened up like
an umbrella, darkening the landscape, throwing
the base of the upper works into deep shadow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's been an explosion!&quot; cried Steve.
&quot;They'll all be lost down there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lad sprang forward, running with all
speed toward the mouth of the shaft. Ere he
had reached it, however, sparks were belching
from the mouth of the shaft. The smoke was
so dense, however, that the shaft was almost
hidden from view.</p>

<p class="indent">Men were running toward the scene from all
directions, shouting and yelling. Steve was not
saying a word. As he ran his mind was actively
at work. He understood what was happening
underground. He did not know what the cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
had been, though he believed there had been an
explosion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The mine's on fire! The mine's on fire!&quot;
was the cry passed from mouth to mouth. Pandemonium
seemed to have broken loose. The
cage gong at the shaft entrance could be heard
through the heavy smoke, crashing out its plea
for help.</p>

<p class="indent">The cage-tender was too excited to give the
signal any heed. He had run from the mouth
of the shaft, half suffocated by the smoke. Steve
dashed up to the man, grabbed him by the collar
and spun the fellow about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get to work! There are men down in the
mine trying to get up. Start the cage!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I can't. The smoke will strangle me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haul up that cage, you coward!&quot; roared
Rush, giving the man a shove that sent him staggering
toward the shaft. The fellow was about
to turn back when he saw Steve striding quickly
after him. Then he dived into the dense smoke,
answered the signal and began hauling up the
cage. Rush followed him, dipping his own
handkerchief into a pail of water as he passed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stuff the handkerchief into your mouth.
Get somebody to keep you supplied with wet
cloths.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cage came to a rattling stop and a dozen
black-faced miners staggered out into the open.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Steve dragged them out into the fresh air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's happened down there? Tell me
quick!&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a roaring furnace! The whole mine's
afire,&quot; gasped the man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are there any alive to come up in the cage?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;N-n-n-no.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send the cage down!&quot; commanded Rush,
dashing to the mouth of the shaft. &quot;Watch
sharp for signals. Stand by your post unless
you want to be thrown in. Be a man! This is
no place for cowards. Where's the superintendent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve dashed out. A new idea had occurred
to him. He rubbed the smoke from his smarting
eyes as he emerged into the open. The lad
was so dizzy on account of the smoke from the
burning mine that he could scarcely keep his
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as he was able to collect his senses
he glanced toward the shaft where the lumber
skip went down into the mine to carry the timber
for the bull gang, the timber used in shoring up
the levels to keep them from caving in.</p>

<p class="indent">There was smoke there, too, but Rush noted
that it was not nearly so dense as in the main
shaft.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe there is much fire near that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
shaft. I hope the men have been able to get
to that part of the mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boy started on a run for the
lumber skip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where's your skip?&quot; he demanded sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the first level.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerk it up here! Why aren't you bringing
up the men on it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven't had any orders to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush restrained himself with difficulty. The
skip came up with a bound and the lad jumped
into it, bracing his feet on the narrow flooring,
grasping the shelving steel over his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drop me to the twentieth. Let her go full
speed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll be killed,&quot; warned the skip-tender.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do as I tell you, and be quick about it, unless
you want to answer to me here and now.
I'll&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve's words were cut short. The skip-tender
threw his throttle wide open. The skip
shot down at a frightful rate of speed. The
rapidity of his descent took the boy's breath
away. He gasped, opening his mouth wide to
fill his lungs with air. But he did not succeed
very well. He feared that he would fall from
the skip in his dizziness, there being no guards
to prevent his doing so. The front of the scoop-shaped
skip was not protected in any way, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
the slightest slip would send the solitary passenger
to his death.</p>

<p class="indent">The skip stopped with a jolt that hurled Steve
Rush forward on his face. He thought that was
to be the last of him. A moment later, however,
the brave lad discovered that the skip had
stopped at the twentieth level, and that he had
been thrown out into the level itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Scrambling to his feet, the lad uttered a shout
to attract the attention of anyone who might
be near.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no reply. Steve nearly strangled
from the smoke he had drawn into his lungs.
The drift was silent and deserted, the electric
lights gleaming dimly in the thick veil of smoke
that hung over everything.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder where they are?&quot; breathed the
lad, keeping his lips tightly shut. &quot;They must
be trying to work their way up by the ladders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Running to another part of the level, the Iron
Boy sprang up a ladder and once more uttered
a long-drawn shout.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello,&quot; came the answer. &quot;Where are
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Chute thirty-one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A man came running through the half darkness.
His face was so blackened from smoke
that Rush did not recognize him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that you, Steve?&quot; cried a familiar voice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
&quot;Yes&mdash;Bob, is that you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's left of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve gave his companion a mighty hug.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are the men? Quick, tell me! We
must help them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've been herding them on the lower level;
that is, all of them that I have been able to
find, but they are the craziest lot I ever saw.
The heathens won't listen to reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How bad is the fire&mdash;is the whole mine
going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It strikes me that it is pretty well gone
already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on! We've got our work cut out for
us,&quot; cried Steve, starting along the level at a
brisk trot. &quot;You've shown great judgment in
getting the men below. Is there much water
down there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not very much, but enough to keep them
from burning to death, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The chums had gone but a short distance
when Rush caught the crackling sound of burning
timber. The smoke was becoming suffocating
and the boys were obliged to move with
more caution.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can't get through there, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; this has started since I came through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall have to go around through the
cross-cut. That isn't on fire, is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
&quot;I don't know. It was not when I was over
there last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many levels are on fire? Do you
know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess most of them are. You see, the fire
works down through the wooden rises, then scattering,
sets the woodwork on each level ablaze.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This gave Steve Rush a sudden idea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They can't all be going. Get together a lot
of the men. We'll station two or three at each
rise with pails of water and the gangs ought
to be able to head off the fire when it comes
through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a good idea. I'm with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boys hurried away. They found
groups of excited men, so beside themselves with
fear that they were powerless to think or to act.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was obliged in some instances to handle
the men roughly&mdash;men much larger and stronger
than himself&mdash;in order to shake some courage
into their trembling bodies.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet he did not blame them so much. It was
a scene calculated to shake the nerves of the
strongest men. The interior of the mine was
a roaring furnace; the flames were crackling
with a sinister sound, eating their way through
the dry timber. Now and then a dull, heavy
reverberation told where a drift or a level had
caved in under the weight of the rocks above it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
In the meantime Rush had explained to the
men what he wanted done. The mine captain
was not in the mine and the men all seemed to
have lost their heads completely. After a time,
however, Steve succeeded in getting a number
of them to the point where he thought they would
be able to obey orders.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush headed the first shift and led the way
to a rise on a level that had not been attacked
by the flames. Stationing a squad there, he
went on to other levels, and other rises, arranging
his forces in the same manner.</p>

<p class="indent">While he was doing this, Bob Jarvis was performing
a similar service. The boys had no
thought, apparently, for their own safety. They
were working to save the company's property,
and at the same time to make it possible for
the men still in the mine to live. By this time
the smoke had become so thick in the lumber
shaft that it was impossible for anyone either
to get up or down. The skips and the cage had
stopped running altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the foremen in the mines had been
stationed at the only telephone that was working,
where Steve directed him to keep the superintendent
informed of the progress of the fire
and of the work that was being done to check it.
At the same time the Iron Boy was calmly
demanding orders from his superior.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
&quot;Tell Rush I have no orders to give. What
he cannot think of is beyond me,&quot; was the answer
sent back to the mine from Mr. Penton.</p>

<p class="indent">No one knew how many lives had been lost,
though everyone believed that a great disaster
had overtaken the miners in the Red Rock Mine.
This was true. Many had been cut off by the
caving in of the roofs of the levels and drifts,
while others, having been overcome by smoke,
had fallen unconscious, some never to rise again.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush, with his companion and a band
of courageous men, was now fighting desperately
to confine the fire to the eastern section of the
mine, which was nearest to the shafts.</p>

<p class="indent">Both boys had thrown off their coats, they
had lost their hats, their faces were black and
almost unrecognizable, and the hair of each was
badly singed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The telephone has gone out of business,&quot;
announced the man whom Steve had assigned
to this work.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well; we shall be in the same condition
if we do not succeed in stopping the progress
of the fire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Every little while the workers were obliged
to flatten themselves upon the ground for a
breath of fresher air. Now and then one would
topple over unconscious, to be dragged out of
harm's way by a companion. On all this Steve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
kept a watchful eye. Thus far he had not lost
a man, thanks to his watchfulness and bravery.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once a new idea occurred to Rush that
startled him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bob!&quot; he called.</p>

<p class="indent">Jarvis was at his side instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about the powder room?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The&mdash;the&mdash;the pow&mdash;&mdash;&quot; stammered Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; what about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why&mdash;why, the fire must be right on it at
this very minute. I&mdash;I never thought of it before.
I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the whole mine will be blown up!&quot;
cried Steve. &quot;<i>There are more than five tons of
dynamite in that room!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span></p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="h2a">THROUGH TUNNELS OF FLAME</p>

<p class="indent">STEVE waited not a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep working, men!&quot; he shouted,
starting away at top speed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come back!&quot; yelled Jarvis. &quot;You'll be
blown to death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll all be blown to death if someone
doesn't stop the fire before it gets to the powder
room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I'm going with you,&quot; answered Bob
Jarvis, following after his companion at top
speed. &quot;It isn't any worse for me than it is
for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stay back there and handle the men!&quot; flung
back Steve over his shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob paid no attention to the command. He
was running at full speed in order to keep up
with his companion, for Steve, with a handkerchief
stuffed in his mouth, was running on the
toes of his heavy shoes, darting in and out of
drifts, making sharp detours to get around a
burning spot that was too hot to be passed with
safety.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep shouting, or I'll lose you,&quot; cried Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't! I'll choke!&quot; was the faint answer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
On raced the two boys, Bob gaining on Steve
very slowly, struggle as he might to decrease
the other's lead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We're too late!&quot; groaned Jarvis, as the lads
came to a sudden halt. Before them the flames
were crackling viciously in the dry woodwork of
the drift leading into the earth for some sixty
yards, where the powder room was located.
&quot;Get out of here, or we'll be blown to smithereens!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bob, we've <i>got to</i> find some way to save
the magazine. Think what it will mean if we
do not! Why, it will wreck the whole mine and
the chances are that not a man of all the crew
will get out alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but how are we going to do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve stood thoughtful for a moment, while
second by second the flames were eating farther
and farther into the drift, drawing nearer and
nearer to the deadly stuff that was piled in cases
behind the wooden partition that stood in the
drift beyond the flames just around the bend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going through,&quot; announced Steve firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not going to try to get through that
burning drift, are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's exactly what I am going to do. It's
our only hope, old man. We're surely doomed
if I don't. If I fail then I shall have done my
best. Take off your shirt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I want to use it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why don't you take off your own?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is exactly what I am going to do,&quot; answered
the lad, proceeding to strip off the
garment. &quot;Be quick! We've no time to lose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob began reluctantly to remove his own shirt,
which he tossed to Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, what are you going to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush did not answer. He began wrapping
the two shirts about his head, having first made
slits in one of them through which he could see.
Both garments were finally twisted about his
head until the latter looked several times its
natural size.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I want you to stick right here. If I
am overcome you'll have to try your best to
get me out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I'll be in nice shape to go after you.
I'll singe the skin all off my body if I try it.
You get out the best way you can, but, mind
you, if that fire creeps much closer to the magazine
you'll see me making a lively sprint for
a safe place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There will be no safe place in the mine if
that happens, Bob. I guess you won't run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I guess I won't, at that,&quot; admitted the
lad. &quot;What are you going to do when you get
in there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
&quot;I am going to try to block the passage so
the fire can't get to the magazine. I can't do
any less than fail. I will shout if I get safely
through the fire; then you will know that I am
all right. Good-bye, Bob, if I do not see you
again. In case anything happens to me, try to
get the men as far away as possible before the
blow-up occurs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush bravely bolted into the tunnel of
fire. There was fire above his head, sparks falling
in a perfect cataract about him, while the
drift was full of suffocating smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob stood with head bent forward in a listening
attitude, apparently unmindful of the shower
of burning cinders that fell over him. His whole
attention was centred on listening for the call
that would signal Steve Rush's safe arrival on
the other side of the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">It came at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who-o-o-o-o-p!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's made it!&quot; breathed Bob, with a deep
sigh of relief. &quot;I wonder what he is going to
try to do? I ought to be in there with him, instead
of standing out here doing nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime Steve, having penetrated beyond
the fire zone, made his way quickly to the
wooden partition behind which lay the boxes
of high explosives. He gave the door a sharp
push, but it did not yield.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
It is locked!&quot; groaned the boy. &quot;I've got
to get in there, I've got to do it or we are all
lost!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fire was by this time less than fifty feet
behind him, creeping along toward the powder
room at a rapid rate.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve backed off and threw himself against
the door with all his strength. But the door
did not move.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more did the lad try to break the door
in, the rough wood tearing the skin from his
shoulders, sending the blood trickling down his
sides in tiny rivulets.</p>

<p class="indent">Bang!</p>

<p class="indent">He hurled himself against the door for the
sixth time. The door gave way with surprising
suddenness. Steve Rush plunged headlong into
the magazine and went down, entangled in the
wreck of the splintered door.</p>

<p class="indent">Following his sudden entry into the powder
room there came a succession of crashes. At
first he thought the dynamite was exploding and
the boy clenched his hands to meet the great
shock that he felt sure would come shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">It did not come. Steve suddenly realized that
the dynamite was not going to explode just
yet; what he had heard was the falling of some
of the dynamite cases to the floor, following the
shock of the bursting in of the door.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
&quot;What a fool I am,&quot; cried the lad, starting
to get to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then that he made the discovery that
he had taken part of the partition down with
him and that he was so entangled in the wreck
that he would have difficulty in extricating himself.
Every second the fire was drawing nearer
the magazine. Steve fought as he never had
fought before. Seconds seemed hours to him,
and the crackling of the flames seemed to be
about his very ears. The more he struggled
the tighter he seemed to be wedging himself
under the timbers and planking that he had carried
down with him.</p>

<p class="indent">With a mighty effort and in sheer desperation
the lad lifted the weight with his body. Then
by a quick wriggle he managed to squirm from
beneath the planking, clearing all but his feet.
These were again caught. They would surely
have been crushed had it not been for his heavy
shoes.</p>

<p class="indent">But now the boy's hands were free, thus enabling
him to use them in liberating himself.
After a struggle of a few moments he succeeded
in getting from under the partition and sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">The electric lights were glowing in the magazine,
the circuit not yet having been broken.</p>

<p class="indent">At a bound the Iron Boy leaped to the far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
side of the magazine. From a box on a shelf
he selected half a dozen white, paper-covered
objects, somewhat resembling wrapped candles,
except that they were larger.</p>

<p class="indent">This done, Steve whipped out his knife and
cut the electric feed wire that led into the magazine.
In doing so he got a shock that nearly
knocked him down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gracious, but that wire is hot!&quot; he exclaimed,
shaking his hand to restore the circulation.
&quot;It never seemed so hot as that before.
Everything is hot down here to-day, and I shall
be in the same condition if I do not make lively
tracks out of here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Running from the wrecked powder room, the
lad sprang down the drift, running straight
toward the fire again. As yet he had not replaced
the shirts about his head, for he was not
yet ready to plunge into the fiery tunnel. The
main purpose of his going to the powder room
had not yet been carried out.</p>

<p class="indent">Reaching a point some twenty feet from the
edge of the fire, the lad thrust one of the sticks
into a crevice in the rocks. One after another
he distributed the sticks in various places, some
of them being wedged behind the lagging that
supported the drift.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few seconds he had distributed them
all, forming a line that the fire would be sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
to touch before it could get by to reach the
magazine.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve could hear Jarvis calling to him now.
Perhaps Bob had been doing so right along,
but if so, Rush had been so occupied with his
task that he had not heard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wh-o-o-p-e-e!&quot; answered the plucky lad.
&quot;I'm coming. Look out for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Taking a final survey of his work, Steve
turned toward the fire again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Getting out of here is going to be more difficult
than getting in,&quot; he decided. &quot;I shall be
well singed by the time I get through that wall
of fire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wrapping the shirts about his head, Steve
dived into the fiery tunnel, holding his breath as
he ran.</p>

<p class="indent">The heat was terrific. He could feel it burning
through his trousers, and he could smell the
burning cloth about his head. He had thrust
his hands into his trousers' pockets, which afforded
some protection.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he stumbled over a timber that had
fallen from its supports and measured his
length on the ground. As he fell he uttered a
shout.</p>

<p class="indent">The fall stunned him, for the boy struck on
his head. Bob, however, had heard the cry. Regardless
of the fact that neither his head nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
his body was protected, Jarvis dashed boldly
into the burning drift. He knew the skin was
peeling from his arms, but he did not experience
any sensation of pain.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once he, too, stumbled and fell in a heap
with a deluge of burning embers and live sparks
showering about him. But Bob was not stunned.
He was very much alive at this particular moment,
for he realized for the first time that unless
he moved rapidly he would be burned alive.</p>

<p class="indent">Just then he felt the object over which he
had fallen move.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steve! Steve! Is that you?&quot; cried Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye-yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob fastened on him with a powerful grip,
and began dragging Rush from the fire, first
having stripped off one of the burning shirts.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve regained control of himself almost instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let go! Run for it! Something is going
to happen!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p class="indent">But Jarvis did not let go. He ran faster than
ever, holding firmly to his companion. Perhaps
he was beginning to understand what Steve expected
to happen. At least he was making all
the speed possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">Both boys drew in a long breath as they flattened
themselves on the ground, well free of
the fire zone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
Steve bounded to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Run for your life!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the magazine going up?&quot; cried Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something is going up in a minute. It may
be the magazine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time Rush grabbed Bob, starting on a
run with him. Both boys were choking from the
smoke they were inhaling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're on fire!&quot; yelled Jarvis. &quot;Stop! I'll
put it out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, no! Keep going. Don't stop. It
won't hurt me to burn a little. I'm already
pretty well cooked&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Boom!</p>

<p class="indent">A reverberating report sounded through the
level, and the Iron Boys were hurled violently
to the ground.</p>

<p class="h2a">THE IRON BOYS WIN</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;NOW we will put out the fire,&quot; announced
Steve Rush calmly, as he got to his
feet and began whipping out the
smouldering sparks on the scant covering that
he had left on his body.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The powder house has blown up and the
mine is caving in!&quot; cried a miner, dashing in
front of them through a cross-cut. A dozen
others were following him, yelling wildly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There go my firemen. Stop them, Bob!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush sprang out into the cross-cut waving his
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop! You are all right if you will keep
your heads.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The magazine's gone up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The magazine has not gone up. Get back to
your stations. How is the fire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were getting the best of it on our level
when the powder house went&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense! I tell you it's all right, but unless
you do keep the fire from spreading into the
other side of the mine you'll go up in smoke, the
whole crowd of you. Now get back to work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the men turned to retrace their steps.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
&quot;He's lying to you,&quot; shouted one of those who
had not turned. &quot;Come with me, and I'll show
you the way out. The kid's gone crazy.&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;"> <img class="border" src="images/iron2pic2.png" width="446" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;Back, Every Man of You!&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back, I tell you! Every man of you!&quot;
shouted Steve, placing himself squarely in front
of the man who had started to run.</p>

<p class="indent">The fellow did not stop. He started to run
right over Rush, when, quick as a flash, Steve's
clenched fist landed on the miner's jaw, sending
the man down in a heap. In the meantime Bob
Jarvis, with a howl, had jumped into the fray.
He knocked down two men who sought to force
their way past him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on, you cowards! You'll find my
fist is harder to get away from than the fire in
the lagging. I'll pound every one of you if you
don't get back to your stations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Others had come running along the cross-cut
after the explosion, until there were fully thirty
men in the party.</p>

<p class="indent">Facing them stood the two Iron Boys, naked
to the waist, Steve's body streaked with soot
and blood. The miners stood hesitating. Somehow
the courage of the two lads shamed the
men. They wavered between their shame and
their fears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go back and do your duty like men,&quot; commanded
Steve Rush in a firm tone. &quot;Now that
you are in condition to listen, I will tell you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
that the powder house has not blown up. There
is now little chance that it will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we heard it go up,&quot; protested a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you did not. The powder house, in all
probability, is buried under tons of rock. I
planted the drift with sticks of dynamite. When
the fire reached them the explosion of the dynamite
caved in the drift, thus shutting off the
magazine and burying it. Your danger is from
fire alone. Go back to work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment the rough men gazed at the
slender, resolute lad standing before them; then
the miners, with one accord, uttered a yell. Before
the lads could dodge out of the way the
miners had grabbed the Iron Boys, and, uttering
choking hurrahs, bore the lads back through
the level on a run.</p>

<p class="indent">These same men were ready to fight anything
now. Their courage had come back to them,
increased tenfold. They had realized in a moment
what desperate bravery had been Steve's.</p>

<p class="indent">From that moment on the men fought desperately
against the flames. Little by little, now
that systematic efforts were being put forth, the
fire died out. The mine was still filled with suffocating
smoke, however, and men were being
overcome on every hand.</p>

<p class="indent">From the surface a band of rescuers had begun
to make their way down the ladders into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
the mine, headed by the superintendent himself.
Each was provided with head-wrappings, damp
cloths being placed over mouths and noses.</p>

<p class="indent">The instant the rescuers reached the first level,
Mr. Penton hurried them off to the west, in
order to get them as far away from the magazines
as possible. He expected to hear the muffled
report of the exploding magazine at any
moment, and to feel the ground tremble and
settle beneath his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Reaching a point far enough to the west to
place them out of immediate danger, should
there be an explosion, the party took to the ladders
again and began their descent into the
heart of the conflagration.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime Steve Rush had worked out
another plan. He had visited the most dangerous
places in the mine, learning where the main
artery of fire was. This done, the lad sent out
men to hunt up sticks of dynamite in some of
the working drifts. A few sticks were thus secured.
With these Steve blew down the roofs of
the levels in several places, thus absolutely
checking the fire at these points.</p>

<p class="indent">This done, the men had little difficulty in
handling the other levels. Mr. Penton, during
his slow, dangerous descent, caught the faint
boom of the dynamite sticks. He knew that it
was not the magazine and concluded that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
distant reports he had heard were caused by
the explosion of stray sticks of dynamite that the
fire had reached.</p>

<p class="indent">At last the party reached the fifteenth level,
where the fire-fighting operations were going
steadily forward. No one gave the slightest
heed to the superintendent and his party. The
miners were too busy fighting fire, and they
were working with an enthusiasm and force
that amazed Mr. Penton.</p>

<p class="indent">He hailed a drift foreman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bates, what is the condition down here? I
wish to know the details. You can save me time
by telling me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think we have the fire under control, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the mine badly damaged?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many levels have been burned?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There has been fire on all of them below
this, and, as you probably know, above here,
too. I think Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis can
give you more information than can I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. They're everywhere at once.
I never saw anything like those two young fellows.
You can give them the credit for saving
your mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the magazines&mdash;is there fire near
them?&quot; asked the superintendent hurriedly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;There was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who put it out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush and Jarvis did&mdash;that is, they got into
the powder house, carried out dynamite and blew
up the drift ahead of the fire, so it could not
reach the explosives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The blood rushed to the face of the superintendent
in a sudden wave of emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have any lives been lost?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fear so. We have been too busy to find
out. We knew there was nothing that could
be done; in fact, there was no possibility of our
getting into the other side of the works. If we
could get there the men could get here. I believe,
however, that Rush and Jarvis have pulled
out twenty or thirty men who had been overcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonderful!&quot; breathed Mr. Penton. &quot;Come,
men; we must go through the mine and make
a quick investigation. Bates, have you stationed
men through the various levels to watch?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe Rush has attended to that. In fact,
he did that some time ago. He took matters
into his own hands, and we were very willing
to have him do so, for the men were crazed with
fear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then a man rushed into the level where
Mr. Penton and the foreman were standing.
This man was bare to the waist, his skin so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
blackened with smoke as to render him almost
unrecognizable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is that?&quot; demanded the superintendent
sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's Rush.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve had not observed Mr. Penton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want ten volunteers to go with me to the
other side of the mine. It will be hot in there,
but we've got to look after the men in that section.
Some of them, no doubt, are imprisoned
in drifts that have caved in, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steve!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton strode forward with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steve, my boy, come here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boy sprang forward, grasped Mr.
Penton's hand, then turned sharply to the men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who will go with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; answered every man in the drift.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush, you have done enough. I will head
the rescue party. It is my place to do so,&quot;
exclaimed the superintendent. &quot;Where is
Jarvis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the level below this. He is beating out
the fire on the main and sub-levels. He has done
splendid work, Mr. Penton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I understand. Send for him, and both
of you make your way to the surface, if you
are able to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
&quot;No, sir; we shall stay. We are foremen.
It is our duty to remain in the mine as long
as there is anything to do. Mr. Bates, with the
superintendent's permission, will you relieve
Mr. Jarvis and take charge of the work here
and below as well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton nodded his permission.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Bates.</p>

<p class="indent">Half a dozen men were chosen from that shift,
Steve deciding to pick up others on the way to
the fire-swept part of the mine. Mr. Penton
headed the rescue party, which made its way
as rapidly as possible to the other side.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a sad duty that the men found before
them. The total loss was ten men. Fifty men
in various parts of the mine had been buried in
drifts and it was night before the last of them
had been gotten out. While this was being done
watchmen patroled the levels, Steve Rush having
laid out the plans for this work. Now and then
a fresh blaze would spring up here and there,
but in each instance there were men on hand
to fight it.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as the last blaze had been extinguished
the bull gang began rushing timber
down into the mine, and the timber-men got to
work, shoring up the weakened levels. All night
long the work continued. Neither Steve nor Bob
Jarvis would leave the mine. The Iron Boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
seemed to be everywhere at once, especially at
points where their services were needed. Mr.
Penton found himself deferring to the judgment
of the brave lads. There was still need for cool
heads. He knew full well that he could depend
upon the two boys under all conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">Morning came, though the lads did not know
it until the day shift came down to work. The
mine was still smoky, but it had cleared sufficiently
to enable the men to work. No ore
was to be taken out that day, all hands starting
in to clean up the mine. The Iron Boys, after
having been on duty for twenty-four hours, made
their way to the surface, first having borrowed
jackets to cover their backs. They went to their
boarding house, and, after a bath, tumbled into
bed, remaining there until late in the evening.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND</p>

<p class="indent">MR. CARRHART, the president of the
mining company, arrived early on the
following morning. He was an experienced
engineer, and with a force that is
characteristic of successful men in the industrial
world, he quickly put the mine in working
condition.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime Mr. Carrhart had listened to
the tale of the heroism of the Iron Boys. They
had saved the company thousands of dollars by
their efforts. On the second day he sent for
the two boys and extended to them his hearty
congratulations, assuring them at the same time
that he would show the appreciation of the company
in a more substantial way. He asked Steve
if there were anything he could do for him at
that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir; I thank you,&quot; was the prompt answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Late that afternoon Steve was approached by
an inspector in the mines named Cavard, a Russian.
His first name, being practically unpronounceable,
had remained in disuse so long
that nearly every one in the mine had forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
it. Cavard was called the Duke for short, because
of his dignified carriage and aristocratic
airs. He was greatly respected, however, especially
by the foreign element in the mine, over
whom he exercised considerable influence. It
was Cavard to whom they turned to settle their
differences; it was Cavard who advised them
in their money matters, and it had been rumored
that he had profited through this until he had
amassed quite a sum of money. However, the
man was an experienced miner. He had worked
up from grade to grade until he had become an
inspector, and though the officials of the company
did not like the man personally, they were
forced to admit that he was valuable to them.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve knew Cavard, though he had never
passed five minutes' conversation with him since
the lads had been in the employ of the company.
Steve did not like the fellow; he had
distrusted the Duke from the first. Their dislike
for each other appeared to have been mutual,
Cavard treating both boys with indifference
and scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush was, therefore, rather surprised when
the Russian approached him with cordial, outstretched
hand that afternoon on the level where
the lad was attending to his duties.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to congratulate you, Rush,&quot; said the
inspector.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
&quot;What for?&quot; asked Steve rather brusquely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For your heroism at the time of the fire.
The men are all proud of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. I simply did my duty. Anyone
would have done the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the fact remains, my boy, that no one
did the same. The men were panic-stricken.
They were crazed with fear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I observed. But I hear good reports of
you also. You did your duty, too. Why aren't
they congratulating you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that was nothing. By the way, Rush,
you and I ought to be friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn't aware that we were enemies,&quot; replied
the boy, with a faint smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not mean it that way. I meant that we
ought to get together and come to a better understanding.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you; I am too busy to indulge in
friendships. I am much obliged for your kindness,
though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw, don't talk that way. I want you to
do something for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be glad to do whatever I can for
you, sir. What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come and see me. You and I have much to
talk over. We can talk better in my own rooms.
It may be to your advantage to talk matters over
with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
&quot;What is it you want to talk with me about?&quot;
asked Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve's suspicions were aroused, though what
lay behind the invitation he did not know.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll think about it,&quot; answered the lad.
&quot;Where do you live?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty-three, Iron Street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know the place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might bring your friend Jarvis with
you. He will be interested in what I have to
say. You are both boys of influence in the mines,
and you are advancing rapidly. We ought to
be able to work together to our mutual advantage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush bade the inspector good afternoon and
went about his duties. The lad was puzzled.
That Cavard was influenced by some ulterior
motive he was certain. But, puzzle over the
matter as he might, Steve Rush was unable to
decide in his own mind what that motive might
be. He was at first inclined to accept Cavard's
invitation to call on him. Upon reflection, however,
he decided that he wanted nothing to do
with the man.</p>

<p class="indent">That evening he talked the matter over with
Bob, and Jarvis was of the opinion that the less
they had to do with the Russian the better it
would be for both of them. Later on, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
boys were taking their evening walk, they passed
Cavard strolling along the street with a stranger.
The latter was tall and well dressed. He was
red of face, and when he raised his hat to wipe
the perspiration from his forehead the boys saw
that his head was crowned with a luxuriant
growth of red hair. His small, keen eyes took
in every detail of the two boys in one comprehensive
glance. They saw him ask a quick question
of Cavard. The latter glanced at the boys,
nodding smilingly, then answered the red-headed
man in a tone too low for them to catch the
words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who's the red head?&quot; demanded Bob Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. I never saw him before,&quot; answered
Steve, gazing searchingly at the two men.
&quot;He is a stranger in this vicinity, that is certain.
I wonder what he and Cavard are talking
about so confidentially. By the way, Bob, have
you kept your eyes open of late?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I usually do. What particular thing are you
talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I spoke about before. Since the fire
in the mine there has been more talk than ever
going on among the men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I have observed that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have noticed also that our friend Cavard
has had a most important part in these talks.
I wish I knew what he had in mind when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
urged me to come and see him. I believe that
fellow will bear watching, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I agree with you there. We'll keep an eye
on him. He has nerve, whatever other failings
may be his. He certainly made himself useful
at the fire the other day and the men would lay
down their lives for him at any moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Provided they didn't get an attack of cold
feet,&quot; added Jarvis, with a grin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You couldn't blame them for that. You
must remember that the rank and file of the
men in the mines are ignorant and unreasoning.
In consequence they become easily panic-stricken
in time of danger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that's so. A little knowledge does give
a man more or less courage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because it gives him greater reasoning
powers. It teaches him to reason things out
instead of getting scared and running away.
That is why the Duke is so far above the rank
and file of the workers in the mines.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you're right, at that,&quot; agreed Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I am. But I am convinced that
we shall hear something from Cavard before
a great while that will interest us. He has made
the first move in asking us to come and see him.
Of course we shall not do so, but if he wants
to see us very badly he will look us up, depend
upon that. If he approaches you, Bob, let him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
take the lead, but see to it that you draw him
out if you can without committing yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll do that; don't you worry. I'll show
him I can play at a game of wits just as well as
he can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't underrate the fellow. Remember, he
is a sharp, shrewd man. He is playing a game
unless I am greatly in error, and he is playing
it very shrewdly. We know that, because not
a breath of what he is up to has gotten to our
ears.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you asked anyone about him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I had a talk with the mine captain of
the Cousin Jack the other day. Jim thinks him
a very capable man. He says that Cavard is
one of the best men in the mines, and that the
Duke has more influence with the miners than
has any other man in the mines.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That statement doesn't enlighten us as to
Cavard's game.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but we will eventually find it out. I shall
try to throw myself in Cavard's way without
appearing to do so. Then perhaps he will open
up and give me a clue to what he is driving at.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a good idea. I'll keep hands off and
leave you a clear field to work in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Their further conversation along this line was
interrupted by Mr. Penton, who overtook them
at that moment. He greeted the lads warmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
and walked with them until he reached his own
home, where he left the Iron Boys. They did
not refer to the subject again that night. The
following day was Sunday, a day when all work
is suspended in the mines, no matter how great
the demand for output.</p>

<p class="indent">Late in the afternoon Steve saw Cavard and
the stranger walking out of town, going in the
direction of a little lake that lay a mile beyond
the mining town. After a time Rush observed
other groups moving in the same direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I wonder if the whole town is going
fishing,&quot; mused Rush. &quot;I've a good notion to
follow them out and see what is going on. But
I think I had better stay at home and attend to
my own business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did so, in a short time forgetting entirely
what he had observed. The matter was again
brought to his attention when the men came
back just before the supper hour. Some of the
men from his own boarding house had been out
to the lake. All of them seemed more or less
excited over something. The boys asked a few
guarded questions, but gained no information
whatever, their questions being parried in every
instance.</p>

<p class="indent">This made Steve Rush all the more determined
to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd give a day's wages to know what that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
fellow, Cavard, has got in the back of his head.
I'll bet it would be interesting reading, and I'm
going to make it my business to find out. Something
has been going on to-day, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; it is easy to see that. Have you any
idea what this secrecy means?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not the slightest in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was noticed that the red-haired stranger
still lingered in town. Steve learned that the
man was in frequent communication with certain
of the workers in the mine, spending all,
or the greater part of his evenings at Cavard's
lodgings on Iron Street.</p>

<p class="indent">One evening late in the week Rush walked
down to the village hotel, where he occasionally
went to read the Chicago papers that were kept
on file there. He had seated himself at the long,
paper-littered table in the deserted reading
room and settled himself for a quiet time. He
had been reading for some time when he suddenly
heard his name spoken.</p>

<p class="indent">Glancing up quickly the Iron Boy found himself
looking into the florid face of the red-haired
man whom he had seen with the Duke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good evening, sir,&quot; said Steve innocently,
resuming his reading.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to make your acquaintance, young
man. I have heard all about your heroism at
the time of the fire in the mine. It was a brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
piece of work that you and your friend&mdash;let's
see, what is his name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean Bob Jarvis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that's the name&mdash;that you two did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. Let's talk about the weather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stranger laughed heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you are a humorist. I expect you will
be at the head of a mine yourself one of these
fine days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect to be,&quot; answered the lad so quickly
as fairly to take the other man's breath away.
&quot;That day is a long way off, however.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps not so far off as you think. There
is a way that men of your ability and mind may
improve their conditions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I ask what your business is, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am interested in mines. I am up here on
mining business. By the way, I have some of
the finest samples of ore that you ever saw.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was interested in spite of himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I can show you samples that will interest
you greatly. If you have a little time I wish
you would come up to my room. We can talk
to better advantage there than down here, and
besides I can show you the samples without a
crowd gathering about us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not know you, sir,&quot; answered the lad,
with a half smile.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
&quot;My name is Driscold, Barney Driscold. I
am from Chicago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to meet you, Mr. Driscold,&quot; said
Rush, extending his hand. &quot;Under the circumstances
I shall be glad to see the ore you speak
of. I am always willing to look at anything that
will add to my store of knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. Come with me. I am interested
in young men like you. Where is your
friend to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has gone to call on another friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve rose and started after Driscold. The
latter did not pass through the lobby of the
hotel, but made his way back through the parlor
on the ground floor, opening a door that revealed
a stairway leading to the floor above.
Steve had never been upstairs in the hotel. He
did not even know the arrangement of the rooms
up there. He was a shrewd boy, and perhaps
he was not so much attracted by the promised
exhibition of ore as he was by the idea of learning
something about Mr. Driscold.</p>

<p class="indent">The latter led him down a hall toward the
front of the building, then entered a small, cosy
parlor, which he had engaged for his use while
in the mining town.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a seat,&quot; said Driscold cordially, as he
turned on the lights, then drew up a chair close
to where Steve Rush had seated himself.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
&quot;I guess something is going to start in a short
time,&quot; thought Steve. &quot;Where are the ore
samples, sir?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Driscold brought out a handful of specimens
of copper ore that he had in his bag. These
he laid on the little round table that stood at
the side of his chair.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve picked up the samples. He saw at once
that they were inferior samples, not worthy even
of passing consideration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do these samples come from, sir?&quot;
he asked, apparently deeply interested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From a new mine over in Michigan. I am
interested in the mine and I thought you would
be interested in the ore we take from it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have some ideal conditions in the mine.
Our men are better paid and have shorter hours
than you men have up here. You work ten hours
here, while our men work only eight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume that you would like to have
shorter hours and get more money at the same
time, would you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That depends,&quot; replied Rush evasively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Upon what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it depends upon several things. In what
way do you accomplish this in your new copper
mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
&quot;By organization purely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think I quite understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By organization I mean organizing the
working men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you mean holding up one's employers;
in other words, throttling them and compelling
them to grant one's demands. Is that what you
mean?&quot; demanded the lad with sharp incisiveness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, no, no! You misunderstand me. We
do nothing of the sort. We&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Driscold was interrupted by a rap on the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in,&quot; he called.</p>

<p class="indent">A man stepped into the room. Steve could
scarce repress an exclamation as he saw and
recognized the newcomer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I begin to understand what the game is
now,&quot; thought the boy, as he leaned back in
his chair with a smile of recognition on his face.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE LABOR LEADER'S LURE</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;WHY, Rush, this is, indeed, a surprise,&quot;
exclaimed the newcomer, who was
none other than the Russian, Cavard.
&quot;How are you, Driscold? But I fear I am intruding.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all. Take a seat. We were discussing
matters in which you are interested, I
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I'm listening,&quot; laughed the Russian.
&quot;What is the nature of this interesting discussion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were talking of improving the condition
of the miners by organization. My young friend
Rush rather misunderstood the purport of my
remarks. I was about to show him wherein he
was wrong when you entered.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I am in thorough sympathy with organization,&quot;
nodded the Duke. &quot;It is the one needful
thing in the mines here, and it is bound to
come at no distant day. I am glad we three are
alone here, so we can talk the matter over. You
know, most of our men lack the intelligence to
appreciate fully the kind of argument we are
making.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
&quot;Do you mean that the miners in our mines
are thinking of organizing?&quot; asked Steve, without
appearing to take any great interest in the
announcement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I might say that such a thing is within
the range of possibility.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Form a union?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes; that would be the natural result.
'In union there is strength,' you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I have read,&quot; replied the lad, with a faint
smile. &quot;Then you are unionizing the mines?
Is that it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should hardly want to go so far as to say
that, my dear, young friend,&quot; answered the
Duke. &quot;But I will say that the men have been
considering the matter for some time. I am
placing implicit confidence in you. This information
is not mine to give at the present moment,
so I shall have to ask you to consider all
that I may say as being confidential.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve did not reply to this directly. He sat
thoughtful and silent for a few seconds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you a union man, Mr. Driscold?&quot; he
asked suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Driscold is the president of the Central
Iron Miners' Association,&quot; said Cavard, speaking
for the red-haired man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve regarded the president curiously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;Then you represent all of the unions in the
country, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; not quite that. I am the state president
only. The national body is represented
by another man. Then, in case a union is organized
here, there will be a local president and
other officers, all playing a prominent part in
the organization. Believe me, my dear young
friend, there is a great chance for bright young
men. We want young men to hold our offices,
young men of brains, like yourself. It is the
history of our organization that such young men,
almost from the moment that they assume office
in the union, make rapid strides in their work.
They are sure to earn rapid promotion. We see
to that; we push them along. Why, I know of
a young man about your age who, like yourself,
was a foreman before joining the union. In
less than a year after doing so he was promoted
to be a superintendent. That happened right
in this state, not more than a hundred miles from
where we are sitting at this very moment. Stand
by the union, and work for its interests, and
you will be well taken care of at all times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are the gainers by the organization of
a union?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The rank and file of the men, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how are the officers paid? Surely they
do not work for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
&quot;They are paid very moderate salaries,&quot; Mr.
Driscold hastened to explain, after which he returned
to his original subject. &quot;Are there any
other questions that you would like to ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I should like to know how all that you
promise is brought about. You say that the men
will get better wages and shorter hours. How
do you expect to accomplish that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will explain. I see that you do not understand.
That is not surprising, since you have
had no experience.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir; I have not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will be very frank with you. Corporations
are grasping. They get all they can out of
their men, and when those men are no longer
useful to them, they cast the men aside as they
would a piece of worn-out machinery. They
care nothing for you; they would discharge you
to-morrow were it not for the fact that you are
useful to them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you are wrong, sir,&quot; retorted Steve
sharply. &quot;I have never worked for a corporation
before. The corporation I am now working
for is interested in me to the same extent
that I am interested in my work. I believe all
of these great industrial organizations are looking
for young men who are in earnest. I believe
that they are willing to advance such young men
just as fast as they are fitted for advancement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
At least I have found that to be so in my own
case. Of course we have to work long hours
and work hard. But what do you expect?
Surely you do not look for pay for doing nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no; you misunderstand me entirely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon. You were starting to
tell me how you brought about the conditions
you mentioned a few moments ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. In the first place, the corporations like
to have their men organized. It makes for better
service all around. Well, to proceed, I will
explain that, having organized, we should appoint
a committee to wait upon the official who
is in charge of the mines. This committee would
lay before the superintendent, if he were the
man called upon, such grievances as we might
think existed. There would be a friendly discussion,
and he, seeing the wisdom of what our
committee demanded, would no doubt grant the
request made.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What if he refused?&quot; interjected Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume it would go before the president
of the mining company. At least, we should see
that the grievances were carried to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And if he refused to grant your demands,
what then?&quot; persisted Steve Rush, his keen eyes
fixed upon the red-headed president of the Association.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
&quot;Well, we should find a way to compel them
to grant our demands,&quot; answered Mr. Driscold
significantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to come back to the point of
throttling a man,&quot; said Rush. &quot;I never could
become enthusiastic over the profession of highwayman,
and it strikes me that this is about
what the proposition amounts to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boy was pitting his wits against
those of two shrewd and experienced men, who
were seeking to lure him on by offering him
sugar-coated pills. But Steve Rush knew full
well, young as he was in the world's ways, that
the inside of the pill was bitter and unpalatable.
The lad was holding his own to such an extent
that the man Driscold had adopted a sharp, incisive
tone at several points in the discussion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wrong, Rush,&quot; interrupted Cavard.
&quot;You are altogether wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps I am, but I am trying to get to
the bottom of the question. You spoke, Mr.
Driscold, a moment ago, of finding a way to
compel the officials of the company to agree to
your demands. How would you go about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The president hesitated a moment before replying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, our only recourse then&mdash;our only
remedy, in that event&mdash;would be to call a
strike.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
&quot;<i>Ah!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The exclamation escaped young Rush almost
before he realized it. He bit his lips, and his
face flushed slightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And while the strike was on your men and
their families would go hungry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no; we look out for that. We give
them money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much?&quot; persisted Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A few dollars a week, perhaps, so long as
the money holds out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who gets the money that the men who join
pay in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dues go to the union, of course. The
initiation fee naturally goes to recompense the
walking delegate who, you must understand,
works without pay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It strikes me that he is pretty well paid.
I have not had much experience in the world,
gentlemen, but I am satisfied that your whole
scheme is wrong. It is a hold-up game from
start to finish&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're a fool!&quot; exploded Driscold.
&quot;You're a&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind the trimmings. I may be all
you accuse me of, but I pride myself on possessing
common sense. That, sometimes, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
worth more than knowledge. Mr. Cavard, are
you helping to unionize the mines here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whatever I am doing is done wholly in the
interest of the rank and file of the mines,&quot;
snapped Cavard. &quot;You are making a mistake
in antagonizing us in this way. We had hoped
that you would see the matter in its true light,
and that you might prove a valuable aid to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what way?&quot; demanded Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are popular with the men; you have
a great deal of influence with them, even though
you are a boy. We had hoped that you might
enter into the plan and accept an important office
in the union.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that's it, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is what we had hoped. Think it over.
Say nothing to anyone, but go over the matter
carefully, and I am sure you will change your
mind. Meet us here to-morrow night at eight
o'clock and give us your answer. You have
everything to gain and nothing to lose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen, there is no necessity of waiting
until to-morrow night. I can give you my answer
now. I want nothing to do with such
crooked business as you have proposed to me
to-night. I bid you good night, gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush rose and left the room without
another word.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WOODPILE</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;BOB, I've torn down the woodpile,&quot; announced
Steve, as he entered their
room at the boarding house half an
hour later.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What woodpile?&quot; demanded Jarvis blankly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one we have been guessing about; and
I've found the black gentleman who has been in
hiding there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don't mean that you have solved the
mystery?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you are a wonder. Tell me about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are trying to unionize the mines.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don't say! Who is trying to do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cavard is at the bottom of the whole business,
I believe. He has with him the president
of the Central Iron Miners' Association and they
are putting up this job together, though I believe
the Duke is the real man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that's the game, is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you chance to learn all this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve related what had occurred in the reading
room of the hotel, telling his companion how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
he had been lured to Driscold's room on the
pretext of looking over some samples of ore,
and where they were soon joined by the Duke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did they want of you?&quot; questioned
Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They wanted me to join the union, of course.
They wanted me to use my influence with the
men, promising me quick promotion if I did
join in and help them to organize.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you tell them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't remember all I said, but I made it
clear that I wanted none of it. I am satisfied
that this union business is a delusion and a
snare. Mr. Carrhart talked with me quite a
little on that subject when he was up here some
months ago. He gave me a lot of points about
the methods followed by some of these union
organizers, and he showed me what miserable
things strikes are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I guess they are pretty bad,&quot; agreed
Jarvis. &quot;I have never seen one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I hope you never will. I don't believe
a strike could ever benefit either employé
or employer. Don't you get mixed up with
them, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not I,&quot; answered Jarvis with emphasis.
&quot;I'm pretty well satisfied with the way I am
being used. I've learned a lot of things in the
past year, and most of them I have learned from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
you. I'm very much obliged for the licking you
gave me. You hammered some sense into my
head and I haven't lost all of it yet. When I
do, you may give me another walloping.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I should not be able to do it
now. You have grown since then, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So have you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we are in good shape to thrash somebody
else, if the occasion demands, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You bet! We'll do that, all right. Do you
think there is going to be trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not be surprised. I do not know,
of course, how far this thing has gone, but the
organizers have been working for a long time,
as you and I both know. I am inclined to believe
that the Duke has gotten a strong hold
on the men. You observed how our fellows acted
after they returned from their outing on Sunday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I noticed it. They all acted as if they
had lost their week's wages. So that's what was
going on, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; they must have had a meeting out at
the lake. I wish I knew whether they have organized
or not. I am inclined to believe that
they have not, though. But, if not, they are getting
perilously close to doing so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should we not tell Mr. Penton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had thought of that, but we talked this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
matter over once before and decided not to do
so. He probably knows more about what is
going on than we do. However, if we see it
is going on to a finish, perhaps it would be our
duty to give him a hint of what we know. I
dislike to carry tales of any kind. Again, I
doubt if this is any of our business. We know
what we shall do; we'll fight the proposed union
at every opportunity if the men are going to
strike. I believe it would be the worst thing
that could happen to the men, short of a mine
disaster, and the company, to which we owe full
allegiance, would suffer greatly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are the men going to do when they
become organized?&quot; asked Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Judging from what the two men said, I
should judge they would demand higher wages
and shorter hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob uttered a grunt of disapproval.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Next thing we know they'll be wanting the
bosses to lay them off and pay them double
wages while they are off. I never saw anything
like the cheek of some people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The laboring man is entitled to some consideration,&quot;
mused Steve. &quot;But there is a
limit. We will lie low and attend to our own
business until something else develops.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something did develop later in the week. The
word had been passed quietly about that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
was to be a meeting of the miners of the day
shift to take up the question of organizing. The
meeting was to be held in a bowling alley over
the only livery stable in the place. Only those
were invited of whom the organizers were sure.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob Jarvis got wind of the meeting through
overhearing two of the men in his shift discussing
it. He told Steve at the first opportunity.
The latter thought over the matter all the
rest of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bob,&quot; he said, that night, &quot;I am going to
attend that meeting. Will you come along?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where you go, I go,&quot; answered Jarvis,
laughingly. &quot;But won't they put us out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess not. If they do, it won't help their
cause any. They will be glad to have us there
if they think they can convert us. At least,
we shall know what is going on, and we may
be able to do something for the company.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. We shall see,&quot; Steve replied
enigmatically. &quot;Leave it to me. Don't do anything
rash, but let me engineer this thing. I
may bring trouble down upon my head, but I
have an idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob agreed to &quot;be good.&quot; The meeting was
scheduled to be held that night, and nine o'clock
was the appointed hour.</p>

<p class="indent">The boys delayed their walk that evening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
They did not leave the house until long after
eight o'clock, by which time nearly all the men
from the boarding house had dressed themselves
in their best and hurried away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, they are all going to attend the
meeting,&quot; nodded Rush. &quot;That shows you how
far this thing has advanced.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It certainly looks that way. I didn't think
it was anything like this, did you, Steve?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I did not. We had better be starting
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the way the lads were hailed by Mr.
Penton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are you going in such a hurry, lads?&quot;
he called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are going out for the evening,&quot; answered
Steve. &quot;I have been thinking about
labor unions to-day, Mr. Penton. Are you opposed
to them? Are they a factor for good or
otherwise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The superintendent laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Older heads than yours have disagreed on
that subject. I hold rather pronounced views.
There are unions that are ably managed by
upright, intelligent men. Such unions are a
good thing. The difficulty is that many others
are managed by unscrupulous men, working to
serve only their own ends, no matter what the
cost to the employer. Such unions are a menace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
both to the men and to their employers. That
is my position.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, Mr. Penton, if you were to have a
union, say in your mines here, honestly managed
and directed by upright men, you would not
object to it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most assuredly not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was a new point of view for Steve Rush.
It gave him a broader insight into the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you thinking of organizing a union, my
boy?&quot; asked the superintendent, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, not exactly, sir. If I were to join a
union would it prejudice you against me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all. I know you&mdash;know your honesty
too well. It would be a good thing for any
union to have such men as yourself and Jarvis
with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; answered Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">The boys bade the superintendent good-bye
and went on their way to the meeting place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What in the world did all those questions
of yours mean?&quot; demanded Bob after they had
gotten out of ear shot of the superintendent.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve did not answer. He was thinking
deeply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have something in mind, Steve Rush.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I have, Bob. In fact, I have partially
changed my mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About what have you changed your mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
&quot;I will tell you later.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Reaching the hall where the meeting was to
be held, the chums found the place packed with
miners. As the boys made their way to the
rear of the room, where they saw an unoccupied
window seat, the miners recognized them and
set up a loud cheer.</p>

<p class="indent">Driscold and Cavard occupied seats on the
platform. The men exchanged significant
glances when they saw the boys enter the hall.
They were not quite sure whether they approved
the presence of the Iron Boys. But, in view of
the attitude taken by the miners, the two men
could not well object to Steve and Bob remaining.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Driscold soon after called the meeting
to order. He stated very briefly the purpose
of the organization, which was, in short, he said,
to guard the men from oppression and to look
out for their general welfare. He gave figures
to show how many of the miners of the country
already belonged to unions, and urged the men
to form a union before leaving the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many of you are in favor of doing
this?&quot; he demanded. &quot;All in favor will rise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly every man in the hall rose to his feet,
though the Iron Boys sat quietly in their places.</p>

<p class="indent">Next Mr. Driscold proposed Mr. Cavard for
president of the local union, which was to include
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
all the mines on the range, and from all
of which representatives were present. Cavard
was elected unanimously. Steve caught the
faint flicker of a smile as it swept over the face
of the Duke. Rush nudged his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The next thing,&quot; continued Mr. Driscold,
&quot;will be the election of a secretary. This should
be done before any other business is transacted.
After that you will all sign your names to the
roll. I have a charter already made out for
you. Who will you have for your secretary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steve Rush!&quot; shouted a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush, Rush, Rush!&quot; shouted voices from
all parts of the hall, until the demand became
one insistent roar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I move we elect Steve Rush our secretary,&quot;
cried a man, springing to a chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Second the motion!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Driscold, rather red of face, rapped for order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has been moved and seconded that Stephen
Rush be elected as secretary of this organization.
I will not attempt to advise you. It is for you
to say whom you desire to fill your offices. But
be sure that you make no mistake. Rush may
be a most estimable young man, but you must
remember that he is young.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not so young that he didn't save the lives
of a lot of the men,&quot; cried one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush, Rush, Rush!&quot; roared the miners.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
&quot;All in favor will rise,&quot; announced Driscold.</p>

<p class="indent">He plainly showed his irritation, as did
Cavard. The meeting had taken a turn that
they did not like. Still, the organizers had won.
Affairs were practically in their own hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Every man in the room sprang to his feet,
shouting for the Iron Boy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young Rush is unanimously elected,&quot; announced
Driscold. &quot;The newly elected officers
will take their places.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard took the chair. At that moment several
men swooped down toward the place where
the boys were sitting.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob Jarvis was so amazed that for a moment
he did not speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you going to do, Steve?&quot; he stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to accept,&quot; announced the lad
in a determined tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;you are going to join the union?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I am going to join the union. I would
suggest that you do the same. I have changed
my mind, old chap, and I'll tell you why later.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The miners grabbed Steve, hoisted him to
their shoulders and bore him to the platform,
where they set him down in a chair at the table
placed for the secretary.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h2a">RUSH SCORES HEAVILY</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I AM glad you have thought better of it,
young man,&quot; said Cavard, leaning over
and shaking Rush by the hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve did not reply. His face was flushed, his
lips compressed. He had evidently decided upon
some course of action that was not wholly pleasing
to him. He glanced up sharply. Driscold
was speaking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not usual for one man to hold two offices,
but you will agree with me that there is one
man among us who is peculiarly fitted for the
office of walking delegate. He will always work
in our interest, if you choose him to fill the
second office. I refer to Mr. Cavard, your new
president.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Duke was elected walking delegate with
great enthusiasm, Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis
being the only men in the room to vote against
the proposition. Cavard was smiling to cover
his annoyance at the marked way in which the
boys had opposed him. He flashed a malignant
glance at them, which both lads pretended not
to observe. But they knew that they had made
an enemy of the new walking delegate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
Other officers were elected; men in every instance
who could be easily handled by the one
at the head of the new organization. This having
been done, the president asked if any
member had anything to say, or a suggestion to
make, before they proceeded to the signing of
the roll.</p>

<p class="indent">No one spoke. Each was waiting for the
other. In fact, none of the men in the hall had
a very definite idea as to what he did want.
They were already in the hands of their leaders.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush rose slowly to his feet. Every
eye was instantly fixed upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great Cæsar, he's going to spout!&quot; muttered
Bob Jarvis. &quot;Well, if this doesn't beat
anything I ever heard of in my life! A few
hours ago Steve was roasting the union, and
now he's a red-hot member of one. I wonder
what he's got up his sleeve? He's up to something,
that's sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My friends,&quot; began the lad, with perfect
confidence in himself, for he had been the prize
orator of his class in the high school, &quot;I am
only a boy&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No you ain't; you're a full-grown man!&quot;
shouted several voices at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I said, I am only a boy, but you know
I am your friend, and all of you are my friends.
I had not intended to join this organization,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
but after thinking the matter over I decided
that it was my duty to do so. I had a feeling
that I might be able to help you, though perhaps
not in the way that some of your leaders might
suggest&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard rapped loudly with his fist on the
table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are out of order, Mr. Secretary. I am
sorry, but we have too much business ahead of
us to permit of our wasting time in idle talk.
The hour is getting late, and as it is the first
duty of your presiding officer to look out for
your well being, I would suggest that we finish
our business so that you may all get home to
your needed rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was standing, half turned toward
Cavard, holding the latter with a steady gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no; let him talk. We want to hear
what he has to say. Go on, Rush; we're going
to hear you out, even if we don't get home till
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may speak for two minutes,&quot; announced
Cavard. There was no smile on his
face now. Matters were taking an unexpected
turn, and one that he did not like at all. This
boy was having things too much his own way,
and the Duke made a mental resolve to check
Steve effectually before another meeting was
called.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
&quot;Go on, Rush; go on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lad turned facing his audience again, undisturbed
by the interruption.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I was saying, I am your friend and you
are mine. I have had no experience with unions.
Perhaps others of you have. But I want to
warn you not to be carried away by promises.
Use your own best judgment on all matters.
Let your union mean your uplifting. Don't use
the power of your union for any wrong purpose.
If you have a grievance at any time, talk it over
calmly; look on both sides of every question.
Do not let your leaders influence you against
your better judgment&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I protest against this line of talk,&quot; cried
Cavard angrily, rising and pounding on the
table. &quot;It is treason, men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men, it is <i>not</i> treason! I am your friend,&quot;
answered Steve, addressing the audience.
&quot;Hear me out, then I will sit down. I believe
that our employers have our best interests at
heart. That I believe to be true so far as our
own mines are concerned. Of course I am not
so familiar with conditions in the independent
mines represented here. Those of you who represent
other mines will have to be the judges of
that. You will find your employers are willing,
at all times, to meet you half way and discuss
any grievance, fancied or real, that you may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
have. Consult them freely; take them into your
confidence and be guided by their advice and
your own good sense. As for myself, I shall
stand shoulder to shoulder with you when I believe
you are in the right, but against you if I
believe you are not. I want to thank you for
electing me to the office of secretary. If, at
any time, you think I am not the man for the
place, I shall take no offence if you select someone
else. That is all I have to say at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he sat down there was silence in the
room for a moment; then the miners broke out
in a loud cheer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're all right, Steve. You bet we don't
want anyone else. You've got a head on your
shoulders. You&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard rapped for order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid you men are being carried away
by schoolboy eloquence. You must listen to
the reason, born of long experience, of your leaders.
They will guide you in the right path.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I move that we proceed to the signing of
the roll and adjourn,&quot; said Steve, rising quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob seconded the motion and it was carried
without waiting for the formality of having it
put by the chairman.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard was thoroughly angry. He tried hard
to conceal his displeasure, but the threatening
expression of his face betrayed his inward rage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
He had been outdone by a boy. His well-laid
plans had been turned until they were as a sharp
knife against his own throat. He was perfectly
willing that the meeting should be adjourned,
for there was no telling what this keen, resourceful
lad might propose next.</p>

<p class="indent">The moment the meeting was ended the two
lads slipped from the room, for the hour was
late and they were anxious to get home and to
bed. They had reached the street when a hand
was laid roughly on Steve's shoulder, turning
the boy half way about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean, you young whelp?&quot; demanded
Cavard. &quot;You came here to-night to
make trouble. You wanted to break up the meeting,
but your plan didn't work, did it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are mistaken, sir; I wanted to do nothing
of the sort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did; you <i>know</i> you did. You had it
all fixed to be put in as secretary and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If there was any fixing, Mr. Cavard, it was
not on my side of the house,&quot; retorted Rush
sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean to insinuate that I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no; I am not insinuating. I was merely
stating a fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Duke's face was distorted with rage. He
was making a great effort to control himself, but
was only partially successful. It was not advisable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
to have an open rupture with Steve, for
the latter might do his cause serious harm, considering
the boy's influence over the miners,
which appeared to be almost equal to that of
the walking delegate and president of the union.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a traitor to the union!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be careful, sir,&quot; warned the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here, Mister Man, don't you go to handing
out any loose language around here,&quot; spoke
up Bob Jarvis in a belligerent tone. &quot;We don't
stand for any of that kind of talk, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then be careful that you don't do something
that you will be sorry for,&quot; retorted the Duke.
&quot;I know a thing or two about what you fellows
are up to, and let me tell you that the union
won't stand for it by a long shot! First thing
you know you will be out in the cold; you'll
lose your jobs and you will find that it will be
rather difficult to get others in these parts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that a threat?&quot; demanded Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may construe it as you wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tut, tut; what's this?&quot; demanded the man
Driscold, who had come up in time to overhear
the last remarks. &quot;This won't do at all.
Harmony is what we want in the union, and
harmony is what we must have. What is the
difficulty here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no difficulty so far as we are concerned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
replied Rush. &quot;Mr. Cavard is a little
excited, that's all. He will feel better to-morrow.
Good night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boys turned away abruptly and started
for home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Steve Rush, will you please tell me
what all this means?&quot; demanded Jarvis after
they had reached their room. &quot;What on earth
ever possessed you to join the union after you
had been roasting it so hard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had my reasons, Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I suppose you had.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I joined the union because I believed I could
be useful to it, and to our employers as well,
and that is the purpose that <i>you</i> must have in
view.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don't mean that you and I are going
to be spies and report everything to Mr. Penton,
do you? If that's the case, you may count me
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not. You ought to know me better
than that. What sort of speech did I make?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, it was a dandy! I didn't think it was
in you. You ought to have seen how those fellows
hung on every word. They were sitting
forward on the edges of their seats, every man
of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Except Cavard and Driscold,&quot; laughed
Steve. &quot;I rather think <i>they</i> were on the anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
seat. Well, we shall see. But be careful that
Cavard does not draw you into an argument
that will cause you to lose your temper. I have
an idea he will try to do so, unless he thinks
better of it and tries some other plan. I believe
that man is a crook, Bob Jarvis. I may
be doing him a wrong. If so, time will tell. In
the meantime, we shall do what we can for the
union. I hope Mr. Penton will not lose confidence
in us. He may misunderstand our motive.
If he does, we shall have to stand it; that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may be the means of losing our jobs,&quot;
suggested Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was thoughtful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may have done wrong, but I did what I
believed to be best. Out of the union we should
not have so much influence with the men. In it
we shall be able to do many things for both
sides, being loyal to each.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We're going to try to please everyone&mdash;is
that it?&quot; grinned Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If we are able to do it,&quot; replied Steve earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are we going to explain our action to
Mr. Penton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not try to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if he asks?&quot; persisted Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't answer that beforehand. My answers
must depend upon circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
The boys turned in soon after that, but Steve
Rush lay awake for a long time, thinking over
the events of the evening. He was wondering
whether he had done right; wondering whether
the officials of the company, who had been so
kind to him, would misconstrue his motives and
no longer take their former keen interest in
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've done the best I know how, and I'm not
done yet,&quot; muttered the boy, as he turned over,
buried his head in the pillow and tried to go to
sleep.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h2a">MINERS MEET IN SECRET</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;WELL, Steve, I hear you joined the new
union last night,&quot; said Mr. Penton,
halting in the drift where Rush was
directing some changes in the work of his shift.</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boy flushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir. I hope you have no objection to
my having done so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in the least. We have nothing to fear
from such upright men as you in the union. I
wish they were all of the same calibre. I want
to thank you for the speech you made last night.
Such words do much toward steering the men
in the right direction. I may say that I am very
glad you decided to join.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had decided not to do so, until I met and
talked with you before going to the meeting last
evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You gave me a new point of view. I decided
that it was my duty to join and I did so.
Do you think Mr. Carrhart will mind when he
hears of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He knows all about it now. He knew that
the meeting was going to take place, perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
even before you learned of it,&quot; answered the
superintendent, with a twinkle in his eyes. &quot;Of
course that is confidential, you understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may be sure that when he understands
the circumstances he will offer no objections.
I know all about what took place last night,
and I heartily approve of your part in it. We
have means of knowing what is going on in our
mines. We have to do these things for our own
protection.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve felt much more light of heart after this
conversation. That his superiors approved of
his action in joining the union relieved him of
a great weight.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the mine had been whipped into
working condition once more, and the work was
going on with renewed vigor. The men, too,
with the promises of the labor leaders still fresh
in their minds, went about their duties much
more cheerfully than before.</p>

<p class="indent">However, there were, if anything, more meetings
than before. There were conferences outside
of the mine that the Iron Boys knew nothing
about. Neither did Mr. Penton have knowledge
of these secret meetings, in spite of the detective
organization that existed in the mines unknown
to the miners themselves. Cavard himself did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
not appear to be active, but there were others
who were active for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten days had passed, then another meeting
of the union was held. There were not more
than twenty of the members present. The young
secretary was among the absentees.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard called the meeting to order, commenting
upon the small attendance. Then he made
a speech in which he indulged in some plain
talk regarding the purpose of the union. After
he had done so he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is another matter that I wish to bring
before the members. That is the question of
our secretary. He is a most estimable young
man, but you&mdash;those of you who listened to his
remarks the other night&mdash;will agree with me that
he is too young, too inexperienced to be entrusted
with so important an office. It should
be quite plain to you that he is not in thorough
sympathy with our great work. In other words,
I believe that he is the tool of the bosses. I
have good reason for saying this, though for
obvious reasons I hope my words will not be
repeated. One of our members saw the boy,
Rush, in earnest conversation with the superintendent
down in the Red Rock Mine to-day,
and overheard something that aroused his suspicion.
Rush was reporting some of our private
business. What do you think of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
A murmur arose from the audience. Cavard
waited that the full force of his words might
take effect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's a traitor!&quot; shouted a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not want to say that, men. I should
call him an irresponsible boy, who is serving
the purposes of the bosses without being fully
aware that he is doing so. Of course the matter
is in your hands to dispose of as you may
see fit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put him out!&quot; shouted one of the members.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Down with all traitors!&quot; cried another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. President, this is a serious charge that
you have made against our secretary,&quot; said an
elderly miner. &quot;You are quite sure that he is
a traitor to the union?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what would you suggest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I have already said, I do not believe the
boy is so much to blame, but the effect is the
same as if he were a traitor in reality.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall we do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might, if you saw fit, choose another secretary,&quot;
purred the Russian.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; that is what should be done under the
circumstances. But is such an act in order?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes. Charges can be preferred against
him. We have as yet no by-laws. Some one
might make a motion to depose him, if you think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
best, embodying the charges in that motion;
then we can proceed to choose another secretary,&quot;
urged the chairman. &quot;The matter is in
your hands, gentlemen,&quot; he added, rubbing his
palms together. &quot;It is not for me to suggest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who would you put in his place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not for me to say, but some such man
as Mike Caldert might make an excellent secretary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The motion, as suggested by Cavard, who
would not suggest, was made and quickly carried.
Then Mike Caldert was duly elected as
the permanent secretary of the organization.</p>

<p class="indent">A gleam of satisfaction shone in the eyes of
the Russian. He had triumphed over the Iron
Boy, thus effectually disposing of him, as he believed.
Cavard was a shrewd and unscrupulous
man, and one who would stop at nothing to accomplish
his ends, as Steve was presently to
learn.</p>

<p class="indent">This matter having been disposed of, the president
and walking delegate cleared his throat and
began on a new subject that claimed the attention
of the men at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is another matter, and one of great
importance to every man in every mine on the
range,&quot; he began. &quot;That is the question of
pay and of hours. We are working ten hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
a day and we are getting less money than is
paid by the other mines in the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This statement was not true, but the members
present were not aware of the fact. They took
all that Cavard said as the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is time,&quot; he continued, &quot;for us to take
action in the matter. You should formulate
your demands and present them to the owners
for their consideration. The bosses are making
money. There never has been a time in the
history of the mines when they were making
so much money. Your tonnage is increasing
day by day, and day by day you are doing more
work. But let me ask you, do your wages increase
proportionately? Do you work fewer
hours than before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; shouted a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you share in the profits that you are
piling up for the money kings?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! You're right, we don't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then if that is so, why is it so? It is because
those who employ you are squeezing the lemon
until it is dry, in order that their bank accounts
may grow fat. Take the matter into your own
hands&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will, we will! How shall we do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men had become worked up to a high
pitch of excitement over their leader's words,
which had been skilfully chosen. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
touched the men in a spot where he knew they
were the weakest. He had sown the seed that
was destined to produce a bountiful crop of bitter
weeds, and Cavard, president and walking
delegate, smiled complacently behind the hand
that he drew across his mouth after having
delivered himself of the words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How shall we go about it?&quot; repeated one
of the men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have here a few notes that I drew up
hastily. They form a demand upon our employers
for an eight-hour day and a fifty-cent
rise for full miners, and twenty-five cents for
miners' helpers and all grades below that. It
is a most moderate demand. The owners will
grant it, you will find, knowing as they do that
the power of the union is behind you. I will
appoint a committee to formulate the demands
set down here. Then we will name a further
committee to call upon the superintendent and
present these demands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard named a committee of three, to whom
he passed over, not merely notes, as he had said,
but a formal paper drawn up in detail, embodying
the facts as stated by him.</p>

<p class="indent">The committee went through the form of
touching up the document, making a mark here
and there with a pen and discussing the paper.
Finally they announced their task finished.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
&quot;When shall we present our demands to the
superintendent?&quot; asked the president.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right away,&quot; answered the members.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I will appoint five of our number to
call upon the superintendent to-morrow. Your
chairman, of course, will head the committee
as its leader. We will make an appointment
to see Mr. Penton at his office to-morrow evening
at eight o'clock, if he will see us, and I
think he will,&quot; added Cavard. &quot;I want all of
those present to bear witness that this has been
a regular meeting. You all received your notices
to be present this evening, did you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are prepared to give evidence, if
necessary, that everything has been done in
due form?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, if there is nothing more to come before
the members, a motion to adjourn will be in
order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A motion to adjourn was made and carried,
and the members left the meeting place, Cavard
retaining the papers embodying the demands
to be made on the company.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush, all unconscious of what had been
done, was sound asleep in his bed. But a surprise
was awaiting him on the following day
that would set him thinking harder than ever.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">STEVE'S SUSPICIONS AROUSED</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;ARE you going to the meeting to-night?&quot;
asked a foreman of a shift, pausing
at Steve Rush's main drift.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes, of course; aren't you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess so. I hear there will be something
doing to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This conversation took place on the day following
the meeting at which Cavard had so successfully
outwitted his young opponents and had
carried the meeting through in accordance with
his own ideas. As yet neither Steve nor Bob
had heard of the meeting. They, with others of
their fellows, had received cards that morning
saying, &quot;There will be a special meeting of the
union this evening at the usual time and
place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The cards were undated and they had not
thought to look at the post mark, taking for
granted that the meeting was to be held on the
evening of that day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There ain't going to be any meeting to-night,&quot;
volunteered a miner who had overheard
the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, there is. Here is the card saying that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
there will be,&quot; answered Rush, exhibiting the
card he had received that morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naw; no such thing. The meeting was <i>last</i>
night,&quot; continued the miner. &quot;Ain't you heard
about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve looked at the fellow to see if he were
joking. He saw that the man was in earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was a meeting of the union last
night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure there was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Friend of mine was there and told me about
it. And you ain't heard about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly have not. What was done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A lot of things was done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's queer. My postal notifying me of
the meeting did not reach me until this morning.
When did you get yours?&quot; asked the lad
of the foreman with whom he had been talking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got mine this morning, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That explains it, then; but it is odd that
no one said anything about it yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably didn't get their cards till after
supper last night. Well, I guess we didn't miss
much,&quot; added the foreman, with a grin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven't told us what was done,&quot; said
Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, for one thing, they elected a new secretary.
Didn't you know about that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
Rush peered at the man keenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here, Abe, are you joking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naw, I ain't joking. They bounced you and
elected another man in your place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve could scarcely believe his own ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did they do that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. I didn't ask. But they
bounced you, all right, all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I ask who my successor is?&quot; inquired
the lad, with a touch of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know. I didn't ask that, either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of that?&quot; demanded the
boy, turning to the foreman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe it. They wouldn't be such
fools as to do a thing like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am of the opinion that something was done
there, and it seems mighty queer to me. Have
you seen Cavard to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I passed him when I was coming over
here. He must be somewhere hereabouts now.
We'll walk out, and maybe we shall meet him,&quot;
said the foreman.</p>

<p class="indent">The two men made their way out of the drift
together. Steve was silent and thoughtful. He
did not like this thing that he had heard, nor
did he know what to make of it.</p>

<p class="indent">They did not find the Duke at once, but half
an hour later Steve came across the walking
delegate near the ore rise on the twentieth level.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
&quot;Oh, Mr. Cavard,&quot; he called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Rush; what is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hear you had a meeting last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We did. Why were you not there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I knew nothing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you received a notice, did you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This morning, yes. I supposed from the
card that the meeting was to be held to-night.
I understand others did not receive theirs until
to-day, either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then that accounts for the small attendance,&quot;
answered Cavard smoothly. &quot;The cards
were mailed rather late, but it was quite important
to hold a meeting last night. I wondered
why so few were present. It was most
unfortunate, for very important business was
transacted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I heard. May I ask what was done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Several things were attended to,&quot; replied
the man evasively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Including the election of a new secretary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, yes; I believe so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard showed some slight irritation under
the sharp questioning of the Iron Boy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The question came out with a snap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You should have attended the meeting if
you want to know what was done. We are not
supposed to talk about it on the outside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
&quot;Yes; no doubt I should have attended, but
I did not for the reason I have just given. Why
was I deposed and another put in my place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, to be candid with you, since you insist,
the members did not think you were old
enough, nor that you had had experience enough
to warrant keeping you in such an important
position. You see, they chose you in a moment
of intense enthusiasm. After they had thought
the matter over more calmly they came to the
conclusion that it would be better to have an
older man for the place, so they elected another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Caldert.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mike Caldert?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve laughed uproariously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, that man can barely write his name.
I'll wager he cannot write correctly the name
of the state in which he lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you are mistaken,&quot; replied the walking
delegate, drawing himself up frigidly. &quot;At
least I have nothing to do with that. It was the
will of the meeting, and there was nothing for
me to do but to put to vote the motions that
were offered.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve surveyed the walking delegate with a
sarcastic look on his face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
&quot;Has Caldert the minutes of the meeting, or
have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe he has them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall demand to see them to-night.
I want to know what was done at that meeting,
and I think I have a right to know. I shall
bring the matter before the next meeting and
find out whether you have the right to railroad
through a piece of business like this. It's not
that I care a rap about holding the office, but
I don't propose to be done out of it in any such
way without finding out what it all means.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard saw possibilities of trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't be a baby. Take your medicine like
a man. You are proving that you are not fitted
for an office in the union yet. When you get
older and have had more experience, then perhaps
you may do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was an implied sneer in the man's tone,
which his smiling face failed to mask.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed! I shall bring the subject before the
next full meeting of the union, just the same,
and we shall see whether it will stand or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, young man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The walking delegate dropped his mask of
assumed politeness. His chin was thrust forward
and his eyes gleamed with anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've been too easy with you&mdash;easy because
you are a boy. Now I'm done with this foolishness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
This is a man's game, and men are going
to play it. You can get out of the union if you
want to; we don't need you. But let me tell
you one thing: you mind your own business
after this, if you know what's good for you!
I'm running this union just now, and I'm running
it in the way that suits me best&mdash;that means
the right way. If you don't like it, you get out
and shut up&mdash;that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve laughed in the delegate's face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you are beginning to show yourself in
your true colors, Mister Man. I don't want your
office. I did not care in the first place to have
anything to do with an organization that you
were interested in, but I thought possibly it
might be run by honest men, so I joined the
union.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's that? You throw that at me&mdash;you
accuse me of being dishonest, you young
whelp?&quot; shouted Cavard in a rage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take what I said for what it's worth, and
I repeat your own words: 'If you don't like
it, get out and shut up.' That's my answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve snapped his fingers in the face of the
walking delegate and turned on his heel.
Cavard was at his side in a few quick, long
strides. He gripped the collar of the Iron Boy
and was about to spin him about when Steve
turned on him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
&quot;Unless you are looking for trouble, I
wouldn't put hands on the other man in this instance,
if I were you. If you do that again,
you will answer for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed! And may I ask you if you are in
authority here?&quot; sneered Cavard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, all I have to say is, if you want to
know who's boss on this shift, just start something.
You'll find out mighty quick, and the
knowledge may not be particularly pleasant to
you, either. That's all I have to say to you
to-day. I may have something further to say
later. Good afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush left the walking delegate fuming in the
drift as he walked away. The Iron Boy made
it his business to ask every man he met whether
or not he had received a notification of the meeting
of the previous evening. Some of them had
received their notices that morning, others had
received no notice whatever. Not one of the
miners had gotten his card on the previous day,
so far as the lad could learn.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was determined to get to the bottom of
the matter. He consulted with Bob Jarvis and
the latter proposed looking up the walking delegate
at once and giving him a sound thrashing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Bob, we don't know that he is to blame
in this matter at all, though I have my suspicions.
Even if we were sure, we should gain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
nothing by following that course. There, I forgot
to ask him what else was done at the meeting.
After we get off duty to-night we must
find out what has been going on. I'll see you
and talk it over later.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as he had finished his work in the
mine Rush went directly over to the post-office,
where he waited until the postmaster was at
leisure, when he called him aside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I received a postal card to-day that I should
have had last night,&quot; said the lad, producing
the notification of the meeting and handing it to
the postmaster.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you say?&quot; exclaimed the postmaster.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said I should have received this post card
last night,&quot; repeated Steve. &quot;You see it is quite
important. It is a notification of a meeting and
the meeting was held last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see how you could very well have
received this postal last night, when it wasn't
mailed until this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not mailed until this morning?&quot; demanded
the lad, in well-feigned surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ought to be. These postals&mdash;there were a
lot of them&mdash;were stuffed in through the slot in
the door some time during the night. It must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
have been late, for we didn't close until nearly
twelve o'clock. The postals were all on the floor
when I opened up the place this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you read any of the postals?&quot; asked
Steve innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, I always read postals. Don't have
much of anything else to do part of the day,
you know,&quot; replied the postmaster in a matter-of-fact
tone. &quot;Why, what's in the wind? No
trouble about it, is there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There may be,&quot; replied the lad mysteriously.
&quot;But if you will state the facts when called
upon to do so, there will be no trouble so far as
you are concerned. Will you do that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I'll do that, all right. It won't violate
any regulation of the department that I know
of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. Say nothing to anyone of what
I have asked you to-night, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I have got something on our friend,
the walking delegate, now,&quot; muttered the lad
triumphantly, as he made his way toward home.
He had gone but a short distance when he met
five of the members of the union, all dressed in
their best, hurrying along the street.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve halted and peered at them suspiciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, where are you fellows going?&quot; he
demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To the superintendent's office.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are going to present our demands. You
know the document we decided to present to
him to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve did not know, but he did not say so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going there now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; Mr. Cavard is going to meet us there
at eight o'clock. We are the committee. You
lost your secretary job last night. That's what
comes of being too fresh,&quot; jeered the speaker.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that's the game, is it?&quot; muttered Steve.
&quot;I should like to be present at that committee
meeting. And I'm going to be there, too,&quot; he
added, after a moment's reflection. &quot;They can
do no more than put me out.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="h2a">MINERS MAKE DEMANDS</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;YOU go on about your business. You do
not belong with this committee,&quot;
snapped Cavard as the Iron Boy joined
them at the entrance to the superintendent's
office, where the meeting was to take place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the superintendent doesn't wish to see
me I will leave. You have no business to give
me orders, so attend to your own affairs, if
you will be so good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lad slipped in behind the others and stood
near the door of the private office, where, with
the others, he was awaiting the arrival of Mr.
Penton. The latter entered very shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you this
evening?&quot; questioned the executive smilingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard cleared his throat, assuming his most
suave air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the first place, Mr. Penton, we are a duly
authorized committee with power to wait upon
you. This boy Rush is not a member of the
committee. We represent the newly formed
union. Will you kindly ask the boy to withdraw?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
The superintendent elevated his eyebrows in
mild surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he not a member of the union?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted Cavard with evident reluctance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are here in the interests of the
union?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I see no objection to his remaining.
If you are here in the interest, as you say, or
in behalf of the men of our own mines, any one
of the other men is free to be present and to
hear all that takes place between us. Rush, sit
down, if you wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve, without showing either triumph or satisfaction
in his face, quietly seated himself
against the wall. Cavard's face was dark, but
he made no reply to the superintendent's word
in the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I already have said, we represent the
new union,&quot; continued the Russian. &quot;At a
meeting last night certain grievances that have
long existed in the mine&mdash;that is, you understand,
it is the union speaking, not myself personally?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, certainly. Go on,&quot; smiled the superintendent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certain grievances were taken up and discussed.
The result of that discussion was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
drawing up of certain demands, which the miners
believe you will not hesitate to grant. It had
been understood that these concessions already
had been under consideration by the mine
officials.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not aware that any particular concessions
to the miners have been contemplated.
What are your demands?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The demands of the union are for an eight-hour
day and an increase in the scale of wages.
Neither demand is at all unreasonable&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see your papers,&quot; interrupted Mr.
Penton.</p>

<p class="indent">The walking delegate and president handed
the paper containing the miners' demands to
the superintendent. Mr. Penton read the document
through quickly, then went over it again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These are very radical demands, Mr.
Cavard,&quot; he said, glancing up at the walking
delegate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We think not, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And in the event of these demands being refused,
may I ask what it is the purpose of the
members of the union to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a matter for future consideration.
I have no doubt, however, that a satisfactory arrangement
can be made between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What mines are included in the union?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All of the mines belonging to this company,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
both surface and underground, together with the
independent mines on the range. The other and
independent mines have been represented by
delegates at the meetings thus far.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say this was decided upon at the meeting
last night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And it was a wholly representative meeting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was, sir. The delegates from the various
shafts were on hand, though many were unable
to attend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I say something, sir?&quot; asked Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. What is it, Rush?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I merely wish to present for your consideration
the fact that I believe the meeting at which
these demands were drawn up was not a representative
one. Many of us did not receive our
notifications until this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was your own fault,&quot; interjected
Cavard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg to differ with you. The notifications
advising us that the meeting was to be held last
night were not mailed until midnight last night,
after the meeting had taken place, Mr. Cavard,
and you know that is the truth. It was a 'fixed'
meeting and I am willing to go before a representative
gathering of the union and prove that
fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
&quot;I object!&quot; shouted the Duke. &quot;I did not
come here to be insulted by a young loafer like
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton hammered on the table with his
fist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen, that will do. Mr. Rush is not
a loafer. I consider him a young gentleman
and an honest man. If his point is correct, I
have but one thing to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard's face worked nervously. He was
making a violent effort to control himself. Mr.
Penton was eyeing the man keenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you can show me that these demands have
been approved by a full and representative gathering
of the men in our employ, then I will not
only take your grievances into consideration, but
will transmit them to the officers of the company
for their decision. You no doubt know
that it is not within my power to grant such
sweeping demands as these. Unless it is the
expression of a majority of the men, I decline
to give the matter any attention whatever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to take the word of an irresponsible
boy against that of a man of experience
and recognized standing among the
men in your employ?&quot; almost shouted Cavard,
who was rapidly losing his self-control.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am of the opinion that Rush's standing
is equally as high as your own. You thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
enough of him to make him the secretary of your
organization. As such, he surely should be entitled
to attention and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is not the secretary of the union. The
men fired him out last night. He was&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard checked himself suddenly. His face
flushed. He had said something that he had
not intended to say at all, but his temper had
gotten the better of him, leading him into an
unwitting admission.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush grinned sarcastically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this true, Rush?&quot; demanded the superintendent,
turning toward Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am told that it is,&quot; replied the boy politely.
&quot;I have not yet learned why, but I have a fairly
good idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what do you propose to do about it, my
lad?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to see to it that the men understand
the trick that has been played on them.
I am going to let the majority of them know how
they were fooled as to the meeting. I think they
will be rather surprised. But I beg your
pardon; I have said too much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should say you had,&quot; muttered Cavard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The interview is closed, gentlemen,&quot; announced
Mr. Penton. &quot;You have my ultimatum
in the matter. When you can come to me properly
authorized, I will give your demands consideration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
and not until then. I have nothing
to do with your differences in your organization.
I do know, however, that Mr. Rush is a young
man whose word I would take as far as that of
any man I know. Good evening, gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The superintendent rose, indicating that the
interview need not be prolonged.</p>

<p class="indent">Very much crestfallen, the delegates turned
toward the door, followed by Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will hear from us again, Mr. Penton,&quot;
announced Cavard, speaking with emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very good, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You young whelp, you'll suffer for this evening's
work,&quot; raged the walking delegate when
the callers had regained the street. &quot;I'll see
to it that your path isn't one of roses hereafter.
I give you fair warning. I am the master here,
and you will find that out to your sorrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has been my experience,&quot; answered Steve,
&quot;that men who make the loudest threats are the
least to be feared. Let me tell you, while I have
the opportunity, that the best thing you can do
is to carry on the affairs of the union honestly.
Otherwise you will go down, and the union will
go down with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve turned away. Once more he had defeated
the walking delegate and president of the
union by a masterful move.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="h2a">A WARNING NOT HEEDED</p>

<p class="indent">THE word that was spread by Cavard and
his associates during the next few days
acted as a torch to the minds of the
miners. That the superintendent had almost
turned them out of his office was the information
that reached the miners from various sources.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime the organization was being
perfected, not from any regular meetings that
were being held, for Cavard did not propose to
move again until he was fully prepared. At
the same time Steve Rush began to realize that the
men were looking upon him with disapproving
eyes. He had been a traitor to their cause,
according to the information that had been
subtly instilled into the miners' minds. At first
he did not understand what this new attitude
meant, but gradually the truth began to dawn
upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush held many conversations with the men
who, in the past, had been friendly to him. He
saw, however, that their minds had been
poisoned against him, and he well knew the
source from which the poison had come.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob Jarvis had shared in the dislike that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
growing for Steve Rush, but Bob did not care
particularly. He was a self-reliant boy, well
used to looking out for himself and battling his
way through the world. Steve, on the other
hand, felt that there was a greater principle
involved&mdash;the welfare of the men themselves,
who, he believed, were being misled. And still,
beyond this, was the duty of the Iron Boys to
their employers. Steve had not seen Mr. Penton
since the meeting in the latter's office.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the end of the week notices were sent
out for a meeting of the union. This time every
man in the organization received a notice, this
reaching all the miners of the Red Rock, Cousin
Jack and the independent mines.</p>

<p class="indent">There was an activity on the part of all hands,
never before observable on the iron range.
Cavard, in the short time that the union had
been organized, had formed such a combination
that his power and influence were far-reaching.
His lieutenants were working everywhere. The
plot he had formed was now ready to be put
into effect.</p>

<p class="indent">A definite refusal to accede to the demands of
the miners had been received from the main
offices of the company, no matter whether the
demands were endorsed by every man on the
range or not. The company announced that it
proposed to run its own business.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
While Mr. Penton did not wholly approve of
the attitude of the company, believing in more
pacific measures, he had no alternative in the
matter. Cavard had been notified of the decision
of the officials, and had been told that no
farther conferences could be had, at least for
the present.</p>

<p class="indent">When Steve heard this he shook his head
doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That means trouble, Bob,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It strikes me that there has been nothing
but trouble for a long time,&quot; answered Jarvis.
&quot;What do you think the men will do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to the meeting to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. We shall both go. I have an idea that
it will be a lively meeting. We may not be welcome,
but we shall be there, just the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That night, as Steve was hurrying to his
boarding place, he met Cavard's sister Marie,
who kept house now for the walking delegate.
She was a pretty young woman, and though
Steve never had known her well, she had taken
a great liking to the young miner, having urged
him, on various occasions, to call and see them.
Rush never had done so because he did not like
her brother.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Cavard stopped squarely in front of
Steve, barring his way.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
&quot;Good evening, Mr. Rush,&quot; she greeted, extending
a friendly hand. &quot;You were in such a
great hurry that I thought you were going to
run over me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, I didn't see you,&quot; answered
the lad apologetically. &quot;I am in something
of a hurry to get home and dress for the
meeting to-night, after I have had my supper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just like your name, sir; always in a rush.
You haven't even time to come and see us. I
am beginning to think you do not care to have
us for your friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me frankly why you have always refused
my invitations to visit us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frankly, Miss Cavard, your brother and myself
are not very friendly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that the reason? He thinks that you have
not been loyal to the union.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boy drew himself up proudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will not discuss that subject, Miss
Cavard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, I will walk along with you, since you
are in such a great hurry. Because you and my
brother are not friendly is no reason why you
and I should not be friends, is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps not, but it is better that we should
not be friends under the circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Cavard laughed softly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
&quot;You are a very out-spoken boy, I must say.
You tell me you are going to the meeting to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They had been walking along side by side.
Miss Cavard halted suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should you go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am a member of the union and I must do
my duty whether I accomplish anything or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Don't</i> go!&quot; she said almost sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't go?&quot; repeated Steve slowly. &quot;Why
not, pray?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear boy, I am some years older than
you. I have had more experience with the world,
and perhaps I am better able to understand some
things than you are. You are young and impulsive,
and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why do you advise me not to go to the
meeting?&quot; persisted the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot answer that question. I was in
hopes you would not ask. You must not press
me for an explanation, for I cannot give it.
But please stay away from that meeting to-night.
You can do no good. Everything is settled.
The temper of the men has been aroused,
and I fear there will be trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trouble for whom?&quot; demanded Steve, bending
suspicious eyes upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that I cannot say. Ask me no questions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
for I shall not answer them. Don't you see what
a risk I am running in saying as much as I have
said?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, Miss Cavard; it was
very thoughtless of me. I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will remain away?&quot; she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I already have answered that question. It
is my duty to be there, and no one shall ever
say that Steve Rush shirked his duty as he saw
it. I am not afraid of anything the men may
do there. No one will harm me. I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not be too sure of that,&quot; interjected the
girl quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you, but I must go. I am not
afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry.&quot; She laid a hand on the Iron
Boy's arm. &quot;I am sorry you will not be warned
by me, for trouble surely will follow. You will
treat what I have told you as an absolute confidence?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That goes without saying, Miss Cavard. I
thank you very much. I cannot tell you how
grateful I am for your kindness. I should not
have expected it from Mr. Cavard's sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Cavard's sister is not&mdash;&mdash;&quot; The girl
checked herself sharply. &quot;Good night, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
Rush. If you will not accept my warning, be
careful,&quot; was the young woman's parting injunction.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve pondered over the interview while eating
his supper. Then while he was dressing
for the meeting, Bob demanded to know what
was on his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you heard anything about expected
trouble at the meeting to-night, Bob?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing except what you said. You told me
there was going to be trouble, didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I did, at that. Well, perhaps I
wasn't so far wrong. I want you to stick pretty
close to me to-night, for I have had a warning
that something is in the wind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob gazed at his companion keenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have you heard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing more than I have just told you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who gave you the tip?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not at liberty to say. Perhaps it is a
false alarm, but it is just as well to be prepared.
The miners are very much excited. Have you
heard anything else of interest to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; nothing but what you have heard. The
men are all down on the bosses, and are making
all sorts of threats.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know that,&quot; nodded Rush. &quot;It's too
bad. If anything serious comes of this it will
be due to one man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
&quot;The Duke?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have guessed it. Little does he care
for the welfare of the men. He is working for
Cavard, and for no one else. The man craves
notoriety and power, and he is having more than
his share of both just now. Did you ever meet
his sister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once. She seems to be a mighty fine
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So she impressed me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you ask about the sister?&quot; demanded
Jarvis, his eyes narrowing as he
squinted suspiciously at his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ask too many questions. Hurry up, or
we shall be late. It is nearly eight o'clock now,
and the meeting is called for eight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which means nine. None of them ever gets
there on time, except the fellows who don't
spruce up as much as we do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later the Iron Boys were on
their way to the meeting place. Before they
reached the hall&mdash;the meeting this time taking place
in the town hall, which was much larger
than the place where they had first met&mdash;the lads
found themselves in a great crowd. Voices were
pitched high, and loud conversations were being
carried on in many languages.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is something like what I imagine the
Tower of Babel must have been,&quot; laughed Rush.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
&quot;What a mob! Poor, misled fellows! They believe
they have been greatly wronged. If they
only knew how well they are treated there would
be few to attend a meeting of this sort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No one appeared to pay any attention to the
Iron Boys as they made their way through the
crowd and up the stairs into the big room, where
a couple of hundred men had already assembled.</p>

<p class="indent">Everyone in the room was talking and gesticulating
excitedly. The boys were thankful
that they had been able to gain their seats without
attracting any marked attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard had already taken his place on the
platform, where, with his new secretary, he was
going over some papers spread out on a table
before them.</p>

<p class="indent">Inside of twenty minutes after the arrival of
the Iron Boys the hall was packed, every seat
being taken, while rows of men four or five deep
lined the sides of the room and the aisles.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard rose, swept the assemblage with a
half-triumphant glance, then rapped for order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The meeting will please come to order,&quot; he
said quietly, standing motionless for a moment
after perfect stillness had settled over the big
room. The effect of his attitude was not lost
on the miners. They were already deeply impressed
with the importance of the occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The secretary will please read the minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
of the last meeting,&quot; directed the chairman, resuming
his seat.</p>

<p class="indent">Mike Caldert, the new secretary, rose awkwardly
to his feet, and, in a halting voice, read
the minutes that, it was evident to many, had
not been penned by him. He stumbled over the
unfamiliar words, mispronouncing, running sentences
together, completely ignoring all punctuation
marks.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush and Jarvis were deeply interested in the
reading of these minutes, especially the part that
dealt with the deposing of Rush from office and
putting another man in his place. This part
the chairman read after having taken the book
from the hands of the secretary in order to give
the reading more emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">During the reading Steve's face was pale but
calm, while Bob sat opening and closing his
fingers nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now look out for happenings,&quot; whispered
Steve, smiling grimly.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE VENGEANCE OF THE MOB</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;IT'S an outrage!&quot; exclaimed Jarvis in a
loud tone, causing those about him to look
sharply in his direction.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve gripped his companion's arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be quiet,&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob subsided, but it was with difficulty that
he restrained himself from giving vent to his
wrath. Both lads remained silent until the reading
of the minutes had been completed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If there are no objections to the minutes of
the last meeting, as just read, they will stand
approved,&quot; announced the chairman. &quot;There
being no objection, they are ap&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush rose slowly to his feet in an impressive
stillness. Every eye in the room was
turned in his direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I object to the adoption of the minutes as
read,&quot; said the Iron Boy in a steady voice which,
while not loud, carried to every part of the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard's face darkened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On what ground?&quot; he demanded sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the ground that the last meeting was
illegal&mdash;that it was no meeting at all. The last
meeting was a secret meeting, attended only by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
those whom certain persons in this organization
wished to have present&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wrong!&quot; said the chairman. &quot;The
meeting was perfectly regular, as you and every
other man here well knows. You are insinuating
that the members of this union have acted dishonestly.
You are casting a slur on every man
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down!&quot; yelled a chorus of voices.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shut up, or get out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men, I haven't finished yet. I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you have! <i>Sit down!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some one jerked the lad back into his seat,
but whether it was a hostile or a friendly act
Rush was unable to determine. He could not
even tell who had done it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The minutes stand approved,&quot; announced
the presiding officer, smiting the table a resounding
whack with his gavel. &quot;What is the further
pleasure of the meeting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no reply at once. Finally a man
in the rear of the hall spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about the company's treatment of our
demands for more wages and less work?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the matter that we have come here
to discuss,&quot; said Cavard. &quot;In view of the fact
that I acted as the chairman of the committee
that called upon Mr. Penton it will be proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
for me to speak on the subject before this meeting.
We presented our petition, which the
superintendent agreed to consider after it had
been endorsed by a full meeting of the union.
Instead of giving it proper consideration, however,
we have received notice that our committee
will not be welcome; that the company will run
its own business. In other words, the company
has broken faith with us. The remedy lies with
you. I am your servant. But let me ask you,
are you going to submit to the tyranny of the
bosses? Are you going to let them trample you
under their feet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no!&quot; roared the miners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then assert your manhood! Show them that
you are men; that you are determined to fight
for your liberty and your homes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In his subtle, unscrupulous manner, Cavard
was working up his hearers to a high pitch of
excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is anarchy!&quot; cried Steve, but his voice
was lost in the uproar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your brothers in the independent mines are
in the same situation. They are ready to join
with you in any action you see fit to take. Their
delegates are here with us to-night to tell you
so,&quot; continued Cavard glibly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot; cried a man in the centre of the hall
whom Rush remembered to have seen in company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
with the walking delegate on various occasions.
&quot;We are among the downtrodden. We
are ready to fight, shoulder to shoulder, with
you, for our rights.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a put-up job,&quot; whispered Jarvis in his
companion's ear.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve nodded. &quot;It is a crime,&quot; he added.
&quot;Those poor, ignorant fellows are being led as
if they were dogs at the end of a leash.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are our friends?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid there are not many of them
left&mdash;not enough to do any good. I see few of
them here to-night. Perhaps they understood
what was going to happen even better than we
did, and decided to remain away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is for you to act,&quot; urged the chairman
insistently. &quot;Now is your time to assert yourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I move that we send an ultimatum to the
bosses, saying that unless they meet our demands
by the sixth of the month we will strike.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They won't agree to your demands, men,&quot;
urged the chairman. &quot;They have already told
you that. Any delay is so much more money in
the pockets of the bosses. I do not wish to
influence you; I merely want to point out the
facts to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we'll strike here and now!&quot; yelled
a miner, springing to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
Steve recognized in him another of the walking
delegate's lieutenants.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! Strike, strike, strike!&quot; howled a hundred
voices. Men leaped to their feet, yelling
madly, beside themselves with excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">The walking delegate, by skilful manipulation,
had stirred the men to a dangerous pitch. They
were ready to do and dare anything. The mob
spirit had taken possession of them. A few moments
more and they would be past all control.
Cavard saw this. Such a situation he did not
desire. His must be the master hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The chairman pounded on the table with his
gavel until it broke, the head shooting over
among the excited miners.</p>

<p class="indent">Little by little quiet was restored.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are accomplishing nothing. Did I hear
someone make a motion a short time ago?&quot;
asked the presiding officer suggestively.</p>

<p class="indent">The miner who had called for a strike rose
to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Chairman,&quot; he began, &quot;I make a motion
that this union declare itself opposed to the
rule of the bosses, and that we call a strike,
beginning at midnight to-night, in all the mines
on the range, both those belonging to the company
and the independent owners, as well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear, hear!&quot; yelled the audience.</p>

<p class="indent">A gleam of satisfaction lighted up the face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
of the chairman for the moment, after which
the expression in his eyes grew steely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Second the motion,&quot; shouted a chorus of
voices.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have heard the motion, gentlemen. It
has been moved and seconded that the Amalgamated
Mine Workers call a strike in all of the
mines, beginning at midnight to-night. Are you
ready for the question?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Question, question, question!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush sprang to his feet. He waved his
hat to attract the attention of the miners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop, men! You are about to make a great
mistake. Do you know what a strike means?
It means that your families will suffer; it means
starvation for your wives and children. You
have been led into this by soft words and false
promises. That man,&quot; pointing to the chairman,
&quot;is using you to serve his own selfish purposes.
The Duke isn't your friend. He
is your worst enemy, and I will prove it to you
before I have done with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Throw the boy out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Order! You are out of order!&quot; shouted
Cavard. &quot;I shall have you ejected from the
hall unless you cease this tirade. Men, there is
a motion before the house and the question has
been put.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
&quot;I insist upon being heard,&quot; shouted Steve
Rush. &quot;I accuse that man of base trickery. I
demand that you give me a chance to say what
I have to say. Then I will leave the hall if
you wish, but I'm going to speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put that man out! He is a traitor to the
union!&quot; thundered the presiding officer. &quot;He
is the mouthpiece of the bosses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A wave of hissing swept over the room, as
if all the serpents of the jungle had suddenly
been let loose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is the tool of the bosses! What shall we
do with him?&quot; yelled a man, leaping to the
bench on which he had been sitting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Throw him out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's two of them,&quot; yelled another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Throw them both out! They're traitors!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Traitors, traitors!&quot; thundered the mob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All in favor of the motion to strike say
'aye,'&quot; roared the chairman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye!&quot; was the response from hundreds of
throats.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Carried. We strike at midnight,&quot; announced
the chairman.</p>

<p class="indent">The diversion of voting on the motion had,
for the moment, drawn the attention of the men
from the Iron Boys. Steve was still standing.
His face was flushed and he was gazing at the
excited faces about him intently.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
&quot;Traitor, traitor!&quot; screamed the mob once
more, turning their attention to the slim young
fellow who was facing them so calmly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;"> <img class="border" src="images/iron2pic3.png" width="448" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;There is the Traitor!&quot; Cried Rush.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is the traitor!&quot; cried Rush, pointing
to the triumphant Cavard. &quot;That is the man
who has brought this about, and all for his own
gain. He is as crooked as the tram road on
the sixteenth level in the Red Rock Mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a yell, the mob surged toward the spot
where Steve was standing. Bob Jarvis slowly
rose to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We're in for it, Steve,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It looks that way. Stand fast!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You bet I will. I am just spoiling to crack
a few of those wooden heads.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back up toward the wall. There is an opening
there now,&quot; directed Rush, stepping out into
the aisle and moving a few paces away from
the place where they had been sitting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men, you're making a mistake!&quot; called
Steve. &quot;I am your friend, and one of these
days you'll learn that I am. I have been your
friend all the way through, but that man has
poisoned your minds against me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Throw him out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Kill</i> the traitor!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words were repeated in several different
language. Huns, Finns, Italians and others
made a wild rush. There were those in the audience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
who were on the side of the Iron Boys;
there were those who would have taken their
part had they had the courage to do so. The
rage of the mob frightened the timid friends
and they quickly made their way from the hall
that they, too, might not fall victims to the anger
of the miners.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve saw some of his supposed friends sneaking
away and his lips curled scornfully.</p>

<p class="indent">A Finn made a vicious pass at Rush's head.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve planted a powerful blow between the
fellow's eyes, the man toppling over backwards
into the arms of his companions. Ere the victim
had been pushed out of the way two other
men had shared the same fate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look behind you, Bob,&quot; cried the Iron Boy,
as he began striking right and left.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob turned just in time to avoid a blow that
had been aimed at his head. He ducked and
saved himself. As he came up he planted a blow
on his assailant's jaw, sending the man to the
floor and rendering him unconscious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on, you miserable cowards!&quot; bellowed
Jarvis. &quot;We can't thrash all of the people all
of the time, but we can thrash some of the people
some of the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment Steve had grabbed a fallen
miner by the heels. The man was slight. Steve
picked the fellow up and hurled him right into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
the face of the mob that was pressing in on him.
Several men went down, but they were up again
in a twinkling and charging the slender lads
with redoubled fury.</p>

<p class="indent">During the tumult Cavard had made no effort
to restore order. He stood calmly on the platform
at the end of the hall, a grim smile of
satisfaction on his face. He had known full
well that this was coming, for he had skilfully
brought it about. Little did he care if the Iron
Boys were killed. There could be no responsibility
on his part. He fervently hoped that they
would at least be so thoroughly beaten that they
would trouble him no further.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus far the lads had held their own. They
were cool and collected, while those opposing
them had lost all control of themselves. This
gave the boys a slight advantage, but the lads
knew they could not expect to hold out very long
against those hundreds of angry men, who were
fighting each other in their mad efforts to get
at the &quot;traitors,&quot; as they called the Iron Boys.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was fighting with as much coolness as
if he were in a friendly boxing match, except
that his blows were delivered with considerably
more force. Bob was proving himself a whirlwind,
charging this way and that, using both
feet and fists, all to equally good advantage.
Many a shin felt the sting of his heavy boot and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
many a face bore the marks of his heavy fists
for days afterward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come down here, you coward, and I'll give
you a dose of the same medicine!&quot; yelled Jarvis,
chancing to catch the eye of the presiding officer
in a brief lull in the fighting. &quot;It's coming to
you, and you're going to get it some time, even
if you don't to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Steve slipped and fell to the floor.
Bob sprang to his assistance, jerking his companion
to his feet. But the move was fatal.</p>

<p class="indent">A kick from a heavy boot laid Bob Jarvis unconscious
on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">With a yell Steve Rush hit the man who had
delivered the kick, knocking him clear over two
benches that had not yet been smashed in the
scrimmage. In doing so Rush had turned his
back on the most persistent of his enemies. They
were not slow to take advantage of the opportunity
thus offered, and leaped upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve went down under the weight that had
been suddenly put upon him, fighting, struggling,
wriggling desperately to free himself. But the
odds were too great, and besides he was exhausted
by his exertions. He realized that the
fight was ended so far as he was concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kill the traitors!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;throw them out! Beat them up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, throw them out! That will settle them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
It isn't our fault if they fall out of the window,&quot;
yelled Cavard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Out with them both!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Someone jerked Rush to his feet, and as he
did so, another planted a blow on the boy's jaw.
Steve's head drooped to one side and his face
turned suddenly pale. He would give them no
further trouble, for he had been rendered unconscious
by the cowardly blow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The window!&quot; yelled a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, out with him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard's suggestion of a moment before had
taken root. Instantly the miners began dragging
the unconscious Steve toward the nearest
window. It was closed, but that made no difference.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, he-o-hee!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There followed the sound of crashing glass
and breaking woodwork as the form the Iron
Boy went hurtling through the window, taking
the sash with him in his flight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now the other!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two men grabbed Jarvis, one at his feet, the
other at his head. Bob followed in the wake of
his companion, turning a complete somersault
as he shot through the window. Bob had the
advantage of Steve in that he had no window to
break through. His was a clean flight, but his
fall was none the less a serious one.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
The drop that the boys had taken was all of
twenty feet. What was below not one of the
strikers cared.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard pounded on the table for order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&quot; he cried. &quot;You are
forgetting yourselves! Now that you have removed
the disturbing elements, you will please
come to order and we will proceed to finish the
business of our meeting. You should not have
handled them so roughly, though I am forced
to admit that your anger was justified. What
is the further pleasure of the meeting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I move we notify the mines and tell the
night shifts to knock off,&quot; suggested a man with
a cooler head, who had taken no part in the uprising.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the men resumed their places, and the
meeting settled down to business again.</p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="h2a">FACING THEIR ASSAILANTS</p>

<p class="indent">JARVIS was the first to recover himself.
He found himself lying half on the body
of his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steve, Steve!&quot; he cried. &quot;Are you much
hurt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob, as soon as he could pull himself together
sufficiently to do so, began shaking his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wake up, wake up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Huh?&quot; muttered Steve, twisting and trying
to raise himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank goodness, they didn't kill you,&quot; exclaimed
Jarvis, hugging his companion delightedly.
&quot;Where are you hurt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I thought the house fell on me. What
was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing much. I just landed on you from
a second story window&mdash;that's all. It's a
wonder I didn't break every bone in your body.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A pile of rubbish had been thrown out that
afternoon, in cleaning up the hall for the evening
meeting. There were papers, excelsior, burlap
and other soft substances in the heap. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
was on this heap that the Iron Boys had fallen
in their plunge from the second story, and to
that heap of rubbish they no doubt owed their
lives. As it was, however, they were badly
bruised and shaken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They must have thrown us out,&quot; said Rush,
sitting up and rubbing the bruised spots on his
body. &quot;The hounds! But no, I shouldn't blame
them so much. Cavard is the man who incited
them to violence. Bob, I believe he planned,
before the meeting, to do that very thing. I
was warned not to come here to-night, and the
person who warned me was in a position to
know what plans Cavard had in mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who warned you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You asked that once before, and I told you
I could not tell you. I wouldn't under any
circumstances give the name of the person who
warned me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me help you up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was painfully getting to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I am able to take care of myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Came pretty near having a fight, didn't we?&quot;
grinned Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Almost,&quot; admitted Rush. &quot;The ones I most
wanted to hit weren't in that mix-up. That is
my greatest regret. Another is that we had to
damage some of the men who were once our
friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
&quot;Served them right! They don't deserve
sympathy,&quot; growled Jarvis. &quot;We didn't give
it to them hard enough. I guess some of them
won't forget the walloping they got for many
days to come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How about ourselves?&quot; questioned Rush,
laughing mirthlessly. &quot;It occurs to me that you
and I are pretty well banged up. I can't see
how you look, but I think I must resemble the
last rose of summer, with all the petals blown
off. My, but my head aches!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind,&quot; soothed Bob. &quot;You are not
the only one. There are others, and there are
other headaches just as bad as yours. What
shall we do now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the meeting still going on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I hear them up there. They are finishing
up the business that we interrupted, I
reckon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going up there,&quot; announced Rush with
decision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn't, if I were in your place. You are
in no sort of shape to get into any more trouble
to-night,&quot; advised Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not intend to get into trouble. Bob. But
I am going back for a moment, just the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I'll go with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well; but don't stir up any more
trouble. We have had enough, and I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
sure that we are entirely blameless, but I could
not sit there and see that man leading the men
into trouble, urging them on to their own destruction,
as it were.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might as well have kept still, for all the
good it did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I guess that's so. You and I seem
fated to get into trouble. Somehow we can't
keep out of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unless we are thrown out,&quot; suggested
Jarvis, at which both boys laughed as heartily
as was possible with their aching bodies. The
laugh did more to restore them to a better frame
of mind than anything else could have done at
that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on, then; we will go up as far as the
door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you going to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just want to say something, that's all; then
we will go home, where we might better have
stayed in the beginning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boys approached the front of the
building and started to enter. They found their
way barred by a guard at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can't go in here,&quot; warned the man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who says we can't?&quot; demanded Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I</i> say so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you don't count. We're going in, just
the same, and if you get funny I'll throw you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
out into the street. If you follow us up and
raise a disturbance I'll kick you down stairs.
I feel just like kicking somebody real hard,&quot;
growled Jarvis savagely, thrusting a belligerent
chin close to the other man's face. &quot;Go on,
Steve; he won't bite.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I hardly think he will,&quot; smiled Rush, as
he started up the stairs, followed by his companion,
the latter turning every few moments
to see if the guard were following them. The
fellow had prudently remained at the foot of
the stairs. Perhaps he had seen something of
the hitting powers of the Iron Boys.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush stepped into the meeting room
and came to a halt about even with the chairman's
platform.</p>

<p class="indent">Every eye in the room was instantly focused
on the lad. He did not present a prepossessing
appearance. His clothes were torn and covered
with dirt, his face was streaked with blood where
it had been cut when he crashed through the
window in his flight from the hall, while his
hands were in a similar condition.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard discovered him about this time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young man, haven't you caused enough
trouble for one night, without coming back looking
for more?&quot; demanded the chairman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not returned to look for trouble. I
have come for one thing, to warn you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
&quot;Against what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Against trouble. I presume you have voted
for a strike?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The members of the union have done so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then let me tell you that that action, which
you brought about by underhand scheming,
marks the beginning of your downfall, Mr.
Cavard. I believe you to be a scheming scoundrel,
and I shall make it my business to expose
you to the men who are following you so
blindly now. Look out, Mr. Walking Delegate
and President. It's a pretty long level that
doesn't bring up against a hard rock heading
sooner or later. I wish my name taken from
the roll of the union. I do not wish to belong
to any organization that you are connected with.
That is all I have to say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Out with you, before I order you thrown
downstairs!&quot; shouted the head of the union.
&quot;You can't resign, because you've been bounced.
The men fired you out of the window; then
they fired you from the union, you and your
handy-fisted friend there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. Good night. When you men
and your families are suffering from hunger and
cold, perhaps you may remember the warning
I have given you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve turned on his heel and limped down the
stairs, with Bob as a rear guard.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
&quot;Hey, Steve!&quot; called Jarvis, halting at the
door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; demanded Rush, halting outside
the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I hand this guard one for luck? Shall
I punch him, just once, good and hard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not. He hasn't done anything to
you. We have had enough fighting for one night.
Besides, I am lame and sore, and I want to get
home. Come along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jarvis followed, but reluctantly. He could
hardly restrain himself from thrashing the grinning
guard at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">When the Iron Boys removed their clothes
and took their bath they realized, for the first
time, how roughly they had been handled. Their
bodies were covered with bruises, but their
faces were unmarked, save where Steve had
been cut by the glass when he was hurled
through the window. There were many other
men, however, whose faces had not fared so
well, and they would bear the marks of the Iron
Boys' fists for days to come.</p>

<p class="indent">The boys were in bed soon after. On the morrow
they were to awaken to new experiences.
Ahead of them was a great strike, in which the
Iron Boys were to play a tremendously important
part, and during which they were to win

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">PROMOTED BY THE PRESIDENT</p>

<p class="indent">AT midnight every mine on the range shut
down.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten thousand men were out for the
time being. Not all of these were in sympathy
with the strike, of course. Many were loyal
to their employers, and would have continued
at their work, but the superintendents of the
various shafts gave orders to shut down the
mines until the following day, when other plans
would be made.</p>

<p class="indent">At daylight on the following morning the
private car of the president of the mining company
entered the town. Mr. Carrhart and Mr.
Penton were in consultation in the latter's
office half an hour later. The president had
been through strikes before. He knew what
they meant, and his face wore a serious expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't care so much on our own account,
Penton. We have a million tons of ore on the
dumps at the mines now, enough to keep us going
until navigation on the lakes shuts down. I feel
sorry for the men, and for their innocent families.
Who is this man Cavard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
&quot;I always have considered him a bright, capable
man. He is an inspector, as you know.
I never saw anything wrong about him until
this matter came up. But I believe he has been
organizing the men for some time. Rush accused
the fellow, in my presence, of carrying
this thing through from dishonest motives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Rush! What about these boys? Then
they are not in sympathy with the strikers?&quot;
questioned the president.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. They both joined the union, not, I believe,
because of any sympathy that they felt
for the movement, but in the light of after
events, it is plain to me that Rush saw what
was coming, and thought he might be able to
stem the tide. It was too big a task for him.
He did not fully appreciate the magnitude of
the task that he had set for himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are splendid boys,&quot; continued Mr.
Carrhart, the lines of his face softening perceptibly.
&quot;Splendid boys. Tell me about their
part in this affair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton did so. He related to the president
the incidents connected with the Iron Boys
joining the union. Of their having pitted themselves
against the man Cavard, of Steve Rush's
speeches and of the fight in the meeting on the
previous night, when the boys had been handled
so roughly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
&quot;The cowards!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Carrhart,
thumping the superintendent's desk with a
powerful fist. &quot;They deserve no sympathy,
and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean the leaders deserve no
sympathy?&quot; corrected Mr. Penton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Do you know how the boys are this
morning&mdash;whether they were seriously hurt or
not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They went home after the meeting&mdash;after
they had reëntered the meeting room and withdrawn
from the organization. I have not heard
from them this morning, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please send over to their boarding place
and find out as soon as you think the people
there are up. I should like to see the boys some
time this morning if they are able to get out.
If not, we will go to them,&quot; announced the president
with emphasis. &quot;How many of our men
will stand by us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have no idea. Not very many.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;While there is no necessity for our turning
a wheel for the rest of the season, we must do
so for the moral effect it will have on the strikers.
We must not give way for a moment. We
already are paying our men better wages than
almost any other mine in the country. It is not
the principle of this corporation to grind its
men down, but to pay them all they can earn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
Yet there is a limit beyond which we cannot go.
Have you any suggestions to make, Penton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I should notify the men that if they
wish to declare the strike off and go to work
within twenty-four hours, all will be taken back
without prejudice and given work all winter.
Otherwise the mines will be manned by others
when we get ready to work them. I should get
into communication with our mine captains and
find out if our engineers, pump-men, electricians
and other practical men are to be depended
upon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It shall be done at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And we must not forget about our young
friends, Rush and Jarvis,&quot; continued Penton.
&quot;I fear we shall have violence before this strike
is ended. The union has plenty of money for
a long fight, but I do not believe a large amount
of it will get to the men themselves, from what
I know about their leaders.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should imagine not. I will go back to my
car for breakfast and you can make your reports
to me there. That, perhaps, will be best. Better
have your notices gotten out at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When the miners went out on the street that
morning they found the town placarded with
the notices, as directed by President Carrhart.
Groups quickly gathered about these notices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
those who could read translating the notices to
those of the foreigners whose knowledge of English
was limited.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon these groups were engaged in excited
discussions. The word went out that a meeting
of the union would be called for nine o'clock.
This meeting was of the briefest nature, lasting
not more than twenty minutes. A stirring address
by Cavard was the final argument necessary
to clinch the matter. The strike was on,
and the men were going to stand fast until the
bosses should yield, which the walking delegate
assured the men the former would soon do.
That owners could not afford to hold out for
more than a month at the longest was the promise
made to the striking miners.</p>

<p class="indent">The meeting ended amid wild enthusiasm,
after which the men strolled about the streets,
well satisfied with themselves and thoroughly
enjoying the liberty and freedom of their new
situation.</p>

<p class="indent">No overtures were made to the mine owners
by the leaders of the strike that day. Cavard
proceeded exactly as if the mine officials did not
exist. Word of what had been done at the
morning meeting had been quickly carried to
Mr. Carrhart. The president smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">The latter had just finished his breakfast when
Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis presented themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
at the private car and were quickly admitted.
Mr. Carrhart greeted them warmly,
bidding them be seated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will talk with you while I look over my
mail and telegrams. Rush, you look as if you
had been pretty roughly handled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush colored.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess I must have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we gave them something to remember
us by,&quot; retorted Jarvis. &quot;There are some sore
heads in that crowd to-day. I saw a few of
them on our way here this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush, I want to thank you for your efforts
in our behalf. It was a brave thing to do, in
the face of the excitement of the men. The company
will not forget what both of you have done.
It is unnecessary for me to ask whether you two
are going to stand by the company.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, sir; it should not be necessary for you
to ask. There never was a moment when there
was any doubt about it. Are you going to operate
the mines just the same, if I may ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Mr. Carrhart, after brief
reflection. &quot;Of course we shall not be able to
get out much ore, but we shall do the best we
can to show the men that we are independent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When do you wish us to go to work?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably at one this afternoon, though this
depends upon whether the superintendent is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
able to operate the machinery. I hear you have
doubts of the honesty of the man Cavard. What
do you know about him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not very much, sir. I know that he did a
very crooked thing in mailing most of his notifications
for a meeting after the meeting had
taken place. Evidently he had privately notified
those whom he wished to be present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hm-m-m! What was Cavard's motive?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not know, but I do know that I consider
him a dangerous man. He has a remarkable influence
over the men. He can lead them into
anything he wishes. Is there no way that he
could be arrested and checked?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Carrhart laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That would be making a martyr of the man.
No; we cannot have him arrested until he has
done something that makes him liable to arrest.
Even then it would not do unless the men
could be convinced that he was working solely
for his own selfish interests and against theirs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we'll prove it,&quot; announced Steve Rush
with emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we will!&quot; agreed Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Carrhart gazed at them quizzically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You boys almost make me believe that you
will do what you say. I am half inclined to
believe you will prove it, if you say so. Rush,
I am going to give you Cavard's position. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
am going to make you a general inspector in
the mines. It is a sort of roving commission,
but it will give you authority to do pretty much
what you like, of course acting under the instructions
of the superintendent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you wish me to do especially?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep the mines going, or help to do so. See
to it, so far as possible, that the company's property
is protected. I do not apprehend any
violence just yet, but it will come unless we are
able to break the backbone of the strike before
cold weather sets in. Do not be headstrong,
but work with caution. You will be in danger
before we have done this. I hope you will both
be careful, for we can't afford to lose you boys
just yet, and now we need the services of every
loyal man in our employ. Report to Mr. Penton
when you leave here, and he will give you your
directions for the work of the day. You will
act as inspector for both the Cousin Jack and
the Red Rock Mines. And, Jarvis, I think I
will have you act as assistant to the mining captain
of the Red Rock. Curb your temper and
keep your head level.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir; I'll try,&quot; answered Bob, smiling
happily. He was delighted at his promotion.</p>

<p class="indent">The interview being ended, the boys bade the
president good morning and hastened to the
office of the superintendent. Angry looks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
directed at them as they passed along the street,
but the Iron Boys gave no heed. They went
on about their business as usual.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Penton was not in when they arrived. He
came in soon after, and the lads told him what
Mr. Carrhart had said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's good,&quot; said Mr. Penton, rubbing his
palms together. &quot;I have arranged to have the
machinery working at one o'clock to-day. All
the engineers are loyal and I have assurance
that quite a number of the men are willing to
stand by us. We shall have quite a respectable
force at work this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we will go over now and start in,&quot;
said Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">The boys found fully a hundred men about
the shafts of the two mines. When the strikers
saw that the boys were going down into the
mine they set up an angry shout. Jeers filled
the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Scab! Scab! Scab!&quot; howled a hundred
voices. But the Iron Boys held themselves
steady, and, entering the cage, were shot down
into the mine.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="h2a">A COWARDLY BLOW</p>

<p class="indent">A TRAINLOAD of miners was brought into
the town on the following morning. Not
half a dozen of them got to the mines.
Pickets halted the men at the station and
&quot;argued&quot; to such good purpose that the newcomers
joined the union then and there, save
for a few who slipped through the ranks of the
pickets and made their way to the mines.</p>

<p class="indent">This kept up for several days. As fast as
the company sent new men into the mining
region the strikers would &quot;gobble&quot; them up.
The strike was being strengthened every day.</p>

<p class="indent">The face of Cavard, the walking delegate,
wore a self-satisfied smile. All his well-laid
schemes were working out according to programme.
The only real opposition that he had
had, that of the Iron Boys, had apparently
wholly disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve and Bob were not idle, however. Aside
from their daily work in the mines, they had
set for themselves the difficult task of gathering
sufficient evidence against Cavard to prove to
the striking miners that their leader was merely
using the strike for his own selfish purposes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
There was more or less work done in the
mines, though no large quantity of ore was
being mined. However, the company was making
a very respectable showing, owing to the
efforts of the Iron Boys, who accomplished the
greater part of the executive work that was
done. Mr. Penton's time was largely taken up
on the surface, while the mine captains spent
most of their hours at the mouths of the shafts,
looking out for the safety of the shafts and
the machinery.</p>

<p class="indent">The striking miners had held themselves well
in check so far as the company's property was
concerned. They made no attempt to damage
it, but the loyal men had suffered. Of late the
strikers had taken to beating the men as they
came from work, whenever the strikers could
lure a man out of the sight of others.</p>

<p class="indent">This caused some of the workers to quit. They
had become frightened. Threats were being
circulated that the workers would be even more
roughly handled if they did not stop working
and join the strikers.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve had not seen Miss Cavard since the evening
when she had halted him and warned him
against attending the meeting. He had thought
over that warning several times since. It told
him that the attack on himself and companion
at the hall had been part of a prearranged plan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
Miss Cavard evidently had learned of it through
her brother, and she had sought to dissuade
Steve from attending the meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There must be some good in the girl, or she
wouldn't have done that,&quot; Steve decided as he
was passing the Cavard home one evening.</p>

<p class="indent">The strike had been on for about six weeks,
and thus far the Iron Boys had avoided coming
into conflict with the strikers, though the lads
had been goaded almost to the point of desperation
every time they showed themselves at
the shaft, or where the strikers were congregated
in the village. The strikers often sought
to draw the boys into a fight, so that they might
have a good excuse to beat the lads.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush and Jarvis were too shrewd to be caught
in the trap. By this time they had become more
and more a thorn in the side of Cavard. They
were interfering with his plans. Their activity
was too great to suit him, and the walking delegate
planned to rid himself of his young foes
in a way that would effectively dispose of them.</p>

<p class="indent">As Steve was passing the Cavard home on
the evening in question, he glanced up and saw
Miss Cavard standing on the front door step.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good evening, Mr. Rush,&quot; she greeted him.
&quot;Won't you come in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you would. I want to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
&quot;You will excuse me, but I could not think
of entering your brother's home, Miss Cavard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is not at home. He is away much of
the time now. I feel that I may trust you, Mr.
Rush. I do not approve of my brother's actions,
but he is my brother, just the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand,&quot; murmured the boy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You remember an occasion, some time ago,
when I begged you not to attend a certain meeting,
do you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You saw that my warning was not idle chatter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like you, Mr. Rush. You are a fine young
man, and I am going to warn you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, more trouble?&quot; smiled Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There may be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it this time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot tell you, for I do not know. I
do know that you have enemies who are plotting
to do you harm. They will get you yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not afraid of them,&quot; answered Steve,
drawing himself up proudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that. That is what worries me.
What can you, a boy, do against a great crowd
of men who are getting desperate? Oh, what
terrible things these strikes are! How my heart
aches for some of the wives and children of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
striking miners! They are actually suffering.
I am doing what I can for the worst cases,
and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I help you, Miss Cavard? I should like
to help someone who is suffering,&quot; said Rush
quickly, evincing a sudden interest in what the
girl was saying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you might, but that is not what I
wanted to speak with you about. I want to
warn you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I am listening. What is the great
danger that threatens me this time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you I did not know. But you must
leave town. You can take a vacation. I am
sure your employers will be glad to give you
one. Why not go home and visit your mother
until this strike is ended?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush gazed at the girl suspiciously. For the
moment he harbored a suspicion that the girl
herself was a part of the plot she said was being
hatched against him. But he put the thought
aside as unworthy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn't do that, Miss Cavard. I should
be a coward if I did, and no one shall accuse
me of cowardice. I am going to stay here as
long as the company has use for my services.
If I am assaulted I shall do the best I can to
defend myself. You may tell your brother that
I do not fear him, if you choose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
&quot;I shall do nothing of the sort,&quot; answered the
girl sharply, flushing. &quot;I wish I might say
something that would change you, that would
make you heed me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I appreciate your kindness; believe me, I
do, Miss Cavard, but my duty is to my employers,
and here I shall remain. If I get the
worst of it, I shall know that I have done my
duty&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There comes my brother. You must go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve swung down the street at once. Half
way down the block he met Cavard face to face.</p>

<p class="indent">The walking delegate stopped directly in front
of the young man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, my friend, what do you think of the
strike now?&quot; demanded Cavard in a mocking
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do I think? I think it is the greatest
outrage that was ever perpetrated on a body
of men who have not the power to think for
themselves. You will have much to answer for
at the day of reckoning, Mr. Cavard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll pass all that, Rush. I have been talking
with the men lately. They express themselves
as being sorry for the way they used you. They
want to make amends&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I should judge from the way they act
toward me when they meet me outside,&quot; interrupted
Steve.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
&quot;That has all been a mistake. The men who
have annoyed you are not the representative
miners. They are the men who have been
brought in here by the company. A pretty tough
crowd&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know who they are. You need not try to
tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our members have commissioned me to ask
you to attend our meetings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What for? So they can give me another
drubbing?&quot; demanded the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no; you do not understand. They want
to apologize. They want you to come back into
the union. Believe me, it is the best thing you
can do. Should you refuse I cannot answer for
the consequences. The men are getting worked
up to a high pitch. I do not know how long I
shall be able to control them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must think me a fool!&quot; replied the Iron
Boy. &quot;Of course I shall not join the union.
I have had enough unionism to last me for the
rest of my life, if all unions are like this one.
I do not believe they are, however.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take my advice and join.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took your advice once, and as a result I
have some of the marks on my body still. I
understand your purpose. You think I am a
little too active, and you take this as the best
way to rid yourself of the annoyance,&quot; added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
the boy shrewdly. &quot;No, thank you. My activity
will continue until I have shown you to your
blind followers in your true colors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve started to pass Cavard, whereupon the
latter quickly stepped in front of him, barring
the Iron Boy's progress.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve's eyes snapped dangerously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to let me pass?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not until I have finished what I have to
say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to let me pass, or have I
got to knock you down first? It must be one
or the other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment the man and the boy stood
looking into each other's eyes. Cavard towered
half a head above the Iron Boy, and he was
strong in proportion. There were few men
in the mines possessing greater strength than
the president of the union.</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden flush suffused the face of Cavard.
Without an instant's warning he let go a powerful
blow straight at the head of Steve Rush.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="h2a">LAMB CHOPS FOR THE BABY</p>

<p class="indent">QUICK as the blow had been, the Iron
Boy had not been caught unawares.
He had been watching the eyes of the
walking delegate, and he had read the man's
purpose some seconds before the blow was
struck.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve swerved his head an inch to one side,
permitting the blow to shoot over his shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">The lad leaped lightly back in order to have
more room in which to swing his body, then
drove his fist straight out from the shoulder.
The fist landed squarely on the point of the
walking delegate's jaw.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard had been caught off his guard. He
had not looked for such a sudden return, and
the failure of his own blow to land had thrown
him off his poise.</p>

<p class="indent">The walking delegate turned half way about
under the force of the blow, wavered for a brief
instant, then measured his length on the wooden
sidewalk, flat on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm sorry I did that,&quot; muttered Steve, with a
revulsion of feeling. &quot;But I had to, or I should
have been roughly handled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
He turned Cavard over, looking into the man's
pale face. Cavard was dazed, but Steve saw
that he was not seriously hurt and would recover
in a minute.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy's inclination was to hurry away. He
conquered it. He was too much of a man to
do a thing like that, so he stepped back a few
paces, where he stood with folded arms waiting
for his victim to recover.</p>

<p class="indent">This Cavard quickly did. He staggered to
his feet unsteadily, still dazed and uncertain.
All at once he fixed his eyes on the face of the
Iron Boy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;you whelp! You&mdash;you'll suffer for
that cowardly blow. I'll&mdash;I'll hound you out
of the camp, or else I'll&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get run out yourself,&quot; finished Steve.
&quot;Good night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With that the lad turned and walked briskly
down the street. Cavard stood gazing after him
for a moment, then started unsteadily for his
own home. Could Steve Rush have seen the
expression on the face of the walking delegate
at that moment, he might possibly have thought
better of his determination to remain in the mining
town and fight his unequal battle.</p>

<p class="indent">The lad also had started for home, but he
was destined to be still further delayed. His
experiences for that night were not yet at an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
end. A heavy hand was all at once laid on his
shoulder with a grip so powerful that the boy
winced.</p>

<p class="indent">He whirled about, expecting to find himself
face to face with Cavard, and ready to do battle.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead, Rush found a giant form towering
over him, peering down into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, Olsen; is that you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">Segunder Olsen was an Icelander, a veritable
giant in stature, and known to be a man possessing
great strength. He had been forced
out with his fellows when the strike was called.
Steve had never passed half a dozen words with
the Icelander. The latter was a taciturn man,
but one who could do a day's work that was
the wonder of the men who worked with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want, Olsen?&quot; demanded
Steve, trying to release himself from the other's
grip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You make this strike, huh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;why certainly not. What made you
think I did?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men say you tell bosses not to pay us money.
Then we must strike and get more. Huh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have told you lies, Olsen. I tried to
prevent the strike. I knew how much you would
all suffer if there were a strike, but the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
would not listen to me. You may go to work
if you wish to. There is nothing to hinder your
doing so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not have me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, they will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You come with me, huh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come; I show you what strike does. You
come home with me, you see what strike does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without waiting for the boy to assent, Olsen,
with his grip still on Steve's shoulder, started,
fairly dragging the Iron Boy along with him.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush no longer offered any resistance. Something
about the Icelander impressed the boy
strongly. There was a note of hopelessness in
the man's tone, though his face was impassive,
which told Steve that the fellow was suffering
great mental anguish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need not hang to my shoulder, Olsen.
I will go with you if you want me to,&quot; said the
boy in a kindly tone.</p>

<p class="indent">But Segunder gave no heed. He held tightly
to Steve's shoulder. The two hurried on, the
Icelander taking long strides. He led the way
to the outskirts of the village, coming to a halt
before a dilapidated, one-storied cottage, the
door of which Olsen pushed open, thrusting
Steve Rush in. Olsen followed, closing the door.</p>

<p class="indent">A solitary candle furnished all the light there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
was in the room. There was no fire in the stove,
though the weather was cold, the snow falling
early in that far northern region.</p>

<p class="indent">A woman sat holding a baby close to her to
give the child some of the warmth from her
own body. She was pale and thin, but Steve
noted that her eyes lighted up as they fixed
themselves upon the face of Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">On a bed lay a girl of some ten years. The
child was thin and emaciated, and the Iron Boy
saw at once that she was in a high fever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Him make strike,&quot; announced Olsen, pointing
to Steve Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame, are you Mrs. Olsen?&quot; asked the
lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered the woman in good English.
&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My name is Rush. Your husband has
brought me here, for what purpose I do not
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He says you are responsible for this terrible
strike. Are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not. I have had no more to do with
bringing it on than you. I did all I could to
prevent it. Your husband is in error. The
men have told him untruths about me. If your
husband wishes to leave the union and go to
work, I will see that he begins work to-morrow.
Has he tried?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
&quot;Yes, sir. He has been to the mine nearly
every day, but they would not take him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whom did you ask for work?&quot; demanded
Steve, turning to Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little captain, Red Rock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean Mr. Barton, mining captain of
the Red Rock Mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he would not take you back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Him no take me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will to-morrow,&quot; said Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, if you will do that for my husband, I
shall bless you!&quot; exclaimed the woman.
&quot;Segunder, this young man is a good man.
Surely he could not have brought this terrible
thing upon us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segunder's face relaxed a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you in need of assistance, Mrs. Olsen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The woman hesitated. Her pride was battling
with her love for her little family.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, sir; we are. We do not care for
ourselves, my husband and myself, but our children!
Just look at them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been to the union, Olsen, and
asked them to give you money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter with the little girl on
the bed there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;She has pneumonia.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you had a doctor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; but he would not come again because
we had no money to pay him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The cur!&quot; muttered Steve under his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have not had a thing in the house to
eat since yesterday morning, and then there was
scarcely a mouthful apiece.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segunder smote the table a terrible blow with
his fist. The baby asleep in its mother's arms
awakened and began crying loudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I kill bosses. I kill them!&quot; shouted Olsen
in a terrible voice. &quot;I bring you here to
kill you. Maybe you lie to me. Then I kill
you, anyhow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segunder, Segunder!&quot; cried the woman
aghast. &quot;This young man is going to help you.
He is going to give you work. Don't you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen grabbed Steve by both shoulders, and,
pushing him over to the light, peered long and
earnestly into the eyes of the Iron Boy. Then
the huge Icelander drew a deep breath that
seemed to come from his boots.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You no lie? You speak true? You give me
work?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow morning. And I will do more
than that. Cheer up, Mrs. Olsen. I am going
away now, but I shall be back within an hour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
You shall have a doctor, and you shall have
something else. Olsen, you stay here until I
return,&quot; commanded Rush sternly. &quot;Mrs.
Olsen, see to it that he remains in the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was out of the place with a bound. He
did not walk this time, but started away on a
run. He knew where there was a doctor, not
far away, and he made straight for the doctor's
house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a sick child in one of the strikers'
homes,&quot; said the lad, as the doctor opened the
door. &quot;I wish you would go and look after
the child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One of the strikers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Olsen&mdash;Segunder Olsen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Who will pay me for attending the
case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve gazed at the doctor in amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, these fellows think we doctors can
work for nothing. They make all sorts of promises,
but when they are out of work they really
expect us to not only keep them, but to furnish
them medicines and treat them in the bargain.
I know the kind. However, I'll go if
you say it is all right. I don't want to appear
inhuman,&quot; added the doctor, half apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind, doctor; I couldn't think of allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
you to work for nothing,&quot; answered
Rush sarcastically. &quot;I know someone who will
be glad to do so&mdash;a man who has some human
sympathy left. Good night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve dashed down the steps and ran to the
office of the company doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, certainly I will go. Why did they
not send for me?&quot; demanded the physician, after
Steve had explained the case.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess they were too much upset to think
of it, after another doctor had refused to attend
the case. Can you go at once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This very minute, my lad. Are you going
that way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not now. I have something else to attend
to, but I shall be there soon. Perhaps I shall
see you. Thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No thanks necessary. I am glad you came
to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will see that your fee is paid, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will do nothing of the sort. The idea!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew I'd find a real man,&quot; muttered Steve,
as he left the house.</p>

<p class="indent">He hurried to his boarding house, where he
routed out Bob Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You come with me; I want you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, more trouble?&quot; jeered Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but not for us. There is a family in
distress. The family of Olsen, the big Icelander.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
They are starving, and one of their children is
dying of pneumonia, I believe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush was hurrying down the street, with Bob
doing his best to keep up with his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour later the Iron Boys staggered
into the squalid Olsen home under the weight of
heavy burdens. Bob Jarvis carried a bag of
coal on one shoulder; Steve Rush a huge bundle
of kindling wood, with a heavy basket in his
right hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here we are again,&quot; he cried cheerily, as
the lads dumped their burden to the floor. The
doctor was already there, working over the sick
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must have some hot water, and at once,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have no fire, sir,&quot; wailed the woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind; we're going to have a fire in
two jerks of a lamb's tail,&quot; exclaimed Jarvis.
&quot;Give me that kindling wood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob was full of importance. He dumped the
contents of the bag of coal on the floor while
Steve was placing the kindling in the stove. In
a moment the kindling was crackling cheerfully
in the stove.</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen sat blinking in his chair. Events were
moving rather too rapidly for his slow-moving
brain to follow them, while Mrs. Olsen appeared
to be dazed by the sudden turn of events.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
Steve had dived into the kitchen, returning
with a battered teapot, a frying pan and some
other articles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't put much coal on, Bob, or you'll
smother the fire. This is going to be a quick-lunch
affair. Where's the forks? Here, Bob;
you set the table. Why are you standing there
doing nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Olsen suddenly realized that she must
do something.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me do it, sir. Such work is not for a
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You never mind, Mrs. Olsen; you just 'tend
the baby. I never had any experience minding
a baby, but I have had in cooking. I've got
some of the finest lamb chops here you ever
saw, and some other things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rush drew from the basket a package of
chops. In another package was a liberal quantity
of steak, which he intended should carry
the family over for another day. The Olsens
looked on in dazed surprise as one thing after
another was taken from the basket. There were
bread, butter, vegetables, coffee, tea, canned
meats, canned peaches and lastly a can of condensed
milk. Such a display of good things
probably never before had gladdened the hearts
of the Olsens at one time.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve set Bob at work paring and slicing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
potatoes they had brought, while he proceeded
to cook the chops and set the water boiling for
the coffee. Rush went at the work as if it had
been his daily task for years. As a matter of
fact, he had gotten the meals at home many
times when his mother had been too ill to do
the work, or was engaged at other tasks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We didn't bring you much coal to-night,&quot;
said Steve apologetically, &quot;because we could not
carry any more. You will receive half a ton
in the morning, and that will keep you going
until your husband can earn money to buy
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Olsen did not answer, for her emotion
was too great for words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This child must go to the hospital, if we
expect to pull her through,&quot; announced the doctor
at this juncture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, doctor; when do you want to take
her?&quot; questioned Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She must go to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segunder,&quot; said Steve, &quot;we are going to
take your little girl to the hospital and make
her well. You will let the doctor have her for
a few days, won't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen nodded, and his wife, with a half-startled
look, rose and, going over to the bed,
kissed the feverish face of the sick child.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will let her go?&quot; urged Steve.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;I will do whatever you advise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's right,&quot; nodded the doctor. &quot;We will
have her out safe and sound in a few days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve did not know whether they would or not,
but he aided in bringing cheer to all the household
that night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I think we are ready for supper. These
chops are done to a turn, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, the kiddie's going to have first shot
at the chops!&quot; exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">Picking up a fork, Jarvis speared a steaming
hot chop from the pan, and, running across the
room, held it out for the baby in Mrs. Olsen's
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">The child extended a chubby fist for the hot
morsel, whereat its mother uttered a cry of protest
and quickly drew the child out of harm's
way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy! Don't do that! It would kill the
little one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, a lamb chop kill anybody? Why,
I've eaten hundreds of them, and they have
never killed me yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth are you trying to do, Bob?&quot;
demanded Steve Rush, turning on his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he wants the baby to eat a chop,&quot; answered
Mrs. Olsen, half laughing, half crying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, of all the mutton heads!&quot; exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
Steve. &quot;Does the baby drink milk, Mrs.
Olsen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, when we have it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that's too bad. But never mind; I'm
going out in a few minutes, and I will send in
some fresh milk for the little one. Come, now;
sit up and have something to eat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The family gathered at the table. The doctor,
in the meantime, had wrapped the child in
blankets, and, telling Mrs. Olsen she might call
at the company's hospital in the morning to see
it, the kind-hearted physician strode out of the
house with his little burden. It was but a short
distance to the company's hospital, and he believed
he would be able to get the child there
much more comfortably in his own arms than
in the hospital ambulance.</p>

<p class="indent">With a gladness in her eyes that had not been
seen there for many days Mrs. Olsen seated herself
at the table. Segunder had to be fairly
pushed there by Steve. Even when the big Icelander
had taken his place at the table he did
not eat. He sat with his big eyes fixed wonderingly
on the face of Steve Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you are all fixed and we will leave you.
I'll send the milk in for the baby as soon as
I can find it. I'll get it, even if I have to milk
somebody's cow on the sly. Segunder, you come
to me at the mine in the morning, and I will see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
that you get to work. Good night, all. Come on,
Bob.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All at once Segunder Olsen's face was buried
on his arms on the table and his huge frame
was shaking with sobs of joy. He understood
at last. All that had been so unreal to him for
the last hour had now become sudden, sweet
realities.</p>

<p class="indent">The Iron Boys hastily left the house, and
though neither would have admitted it, there
was a suspicious moisture in the eyes of each.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE ICELANDER ON THE TRAIL</p>

<p class="indent">ON the following morning Olsen reported
to the mine, as directed by Steve. The
latter had made some inquiries and the
results had aroused his suspicion. Barton, the
mine captain of the Red Rock, denied that Olsen
had applied to him for work. He grew suddenly
red under Steve's questioning. But Steve
had Mr. Penton's authority for putting the Icelander
to work, and the big man, after gripping
Rush's hand until the boy felt like crying
out, went to work with a will.</p>

<p class="indent">When Steve went home for lunch he found
a note from Miss Cavard in which she wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;You offered to help me relieve some of our
poor, suffering people. I am taking you at
your word. There is a family in dire distress
on Cave Street. Their name is Allison. If you
will meet me there to-night at eight o'clock, we
will see what can be done for them. I wish
to consult with you about some other charitable
work, and that is one of the reasons I am asking
you to meet me as stated above.</p>

<p class="right">&quot;Sincerely, <span class="smcap">Marie Cavard</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
Steve decided that he would go. There was
no good reason why he should not, and his heart
really ached for the suffering families of the
striking miners. If there were anything he
could do to relieve their sufferings he would
willingly do it. Already no small part of his
wages had been devoted to this very work. Bob
Jarvis also had contributed liberally to the
cause.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing of moment occurred during the day.
When evening arrived Rush, dressed in his best,
slipped out, not telling his companion where he
was going. He found the house of the Allisons
without difficulty. Steve knocked and was admitted.
The hall in which he found himself
was dark, and the house was as silent as if deserted.
The lad did not even see any one who
might have opened the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, is anybody at home?&quot; he called.</p>

<p class="indent">For answer he was struck a sudden and powerful
blow. It sent the boy to the floor in a heap,
where he lay as one dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Unseen hands lifted the unconscious lad from
the floor, carried him down a flight of stairs and
threw him upon a pile of straw.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was young and strong, and nature reasserted
herself in a few moments. He got to
his feet unsteadily and began groping about him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I wonder where I am?&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
After groping for some time, Rush decided
that he must be in a cellar, but he seemed unable
to find any way out of the place. There
were no stairs, so far as he could determine,
and he had no matches to light that he might
look about him.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush sat down on the pile of straw to think
matters over. He understood at once that someone
had struck him down in the dark hall, but
as to the identity of his assailant he could not
make up his mind. He had a pretty clear idea
why the attack on him had been made. Yet the
more he thought over the matter the more perplexed
did he become as to certain features of
it.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once the thought of the letter he had
received from Miss Cavard entered his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a trick!&quot; almost shouted Steve Rush.
&quot;She tricked me here for that scoundrel brother
of hers. They wanted to get me here, so they
could do me up, and they've won. What a fool
I was! But I'll outwit them yet. I'll&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve paused as he heard the sound of footsteps
over his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, up there!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no answer. The boy shouted again
and again, but no attention was paid to his
shouts. Apparently they had not been heard,
although Steve doubted this to be the case.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
Once more Rush tried to find some way out
of his prison, but, as before, he failed to do so.
After what seemed hours of waiting he decided
that there was nothing to be gained by exciting
himself, so he threw himself down on the heap
of straw, and after a time went to sleep. Being
young and vigorous, he was not kept awake by
his worries.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was awakened in the morning by the
sounds of someone shaking a stove on the floor
above. He listened, and understood that the
people above were preparing breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the lad realized that he was hungry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, up there! Pass down some breakfast,
even if you won't let me out.&quot; Then, in
a lower tone: &quot;If anyone comes down here with
my breakfast, I'll walk over him and out pretty
quick. I smell breakfast, and it seems to be
right here. Whew, but it makes me ravenously
hungry!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve's foot at that moment kicked against
something that he was sure had not been there
on the previous night. He stooped over, when
all at once his hands came in contact with a
tin pan.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush investigated with more than ordinary
curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meat, as I live! And hot, too! Why, the
stuff must have been placed here within a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
short time. And potatoes? Well, I <i>am</i> in luck,
after all. Evidently my jailers do not intend
to starve me to death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve ate with relish, though the meat was
tough and the potatoes were not overdone.
After he had finished the meal he felt better,
though he would have appreciated a wash. He
walked back and forth for an hour or so, feeling
that he needed the exercise, after which he lay
down for another nap.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In the meantime an alarm had been sent out
for the Iron Boy. Bob Jarvis was sure that
something had happened to his companion, as
Steve never had remained away from home over
night before. Jarvis reported the absence to
the superintendent and a search was made. Late
in the afternoon Bob, worried and irritable, met
Olsen. To the latter he explained that Steve
was missing.</p>

<p class="indent">Segunder listened attentively, but without
change of expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where you think he go?&quot; demanded the Icelander,
after Bob had finished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll tell you, Segunder, I believe that man
Cavard has had something to do with this affair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Huh!&quot; was the only comment made by the
giant.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
After his day's work had been finished, however,
Segunder started off downtown. He
walked along with lowered head, gazing suspiciously
into every face he met, as though in
search of someone. Olsen continued his slow
tramping about the village until the supper hour
had passed. He had no thought for this. His
mind was possessed of a singleness of purpose
that would permit of the entrance of no other
thought there.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know where boss he stay?&quot; demanded
Segunder of the secretary of the union, whom
he finally met.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who do you mean&mdash;the superintendent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cavard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Cavard, you mean? I left him at Liberty
Hall just now. He is attending to some of the
union's affairs there. You will find him if you
go there. He isn't going home to supper. What
do you want? You're a scab! They'll serve
you as they did those two scabs Rush and Jarvis,
if you go there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No throw Segunder out of window,&quot; grunted
the Icelander.</p>

<p class="indent">The information that he had obtained did not
seem to elate him. He turned toward the hall,
plodding along with lowered head and set, inexpressive
countenance.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
There was no one to bar his progress up the
stairs, and it was well for such that there was
none. Segunder was going up to the meeting
room regardless of any obstacles that might obstruct
his path.</p>

<p class="indent">The Icelander strode into the hall where, with
head still lowered, he gazed at Cavard with dull,
listless eyes. The walking delegate and head
of the union was absorbed in a litter of documents
on his desk. At first he did not see Olsen,
and there was no one else in the room to inform
him of the other man's presence.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally the big Icelander coughed to attract
the other man's attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard glanced up; then a scowl overspread
his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want here?&quot; demanded the
leader, half irritably.</p>

<p class="indent">Segunder did not answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, what do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you. I come speak with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get out of here! I want nothing to do with
a scab!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go when get ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will go now. If you do not move fast
enough I will throw you out&mdash;yes, I'll throw you
downstairs head first, or whichever way you
chance to start. Now go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard arose to give emphasis to his words.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
&quot;Where you put boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where you put boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What boy are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where you put Segunder's friend Rush?&quot;
demanded the big miner, still preserving his
stolid expression.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be a fool!&quot; he sneered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Segunder not fool. You big fool.
Where you keep boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here, my man; I've heard all I wish to
hear from you. I demand that you leave this
hall at once. I don't know what you are talking
about. I don't know where the boy Rush is.
Furthermore, I don't care where he is. If I
did know I wouldn't tell you, for it would be
none of your business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen nodded reflectively while digesting the
words of the walking delegate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where you put Segunder's friend, Steve
Rush?&quot; persisted the big man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have told you once that I do not know
where he is,&quot; answered Cavard, his face flushing
with anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You lie!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS</p>

<p class="indent">CAVARD uttered a roar and started to
spring from the platform on which he
had been sitting. In his haste he overturned
the table and went sprawling on his face
with the table on top of him.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a crowd of union men came
trooping up the stairs with Mike Caldert at
their head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, what's going on here?&quot; shouted
Caldert.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's Olsen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Scab! Scab!&quot; yelled the miners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's killed the boss! Down him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segunder did not appear to have heard them.
His eyes were fixed on the form of the walking
delegate, wriggling beneath the table. Cavard
released himself, and, leaping to his feet, looked
about for the man who had given him the lie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the hound? Let me at him. He
called me a liar!&quot; shouted the leader.</p>

<p class="indent">With a growl the miners surged toward the
Icelander, getting between him and Cavard as
they did so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You scab! Where'll I hit you first?&quot; jeered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
Caldert, making a vicious swing at the head of
Segunder Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">That was the last conscious moment of Mike
for a full half hour. Olsen took a step forward,
his long arm shot out and Caldert went to the
floor in a heap.</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen faced the crowd, his eyes flashing as
they had not done in a long time before. With
distended nostrils he quietly awaited the rush
of the crowd of miners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on, I vait for you!&quot; growled Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sail in, fellows; we'll down the seal-eater.
It was a chance blow that laid Mike out. Go
for him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The speaker made a leap for Olsen, then went
tottering backward with a sledge-hammer blow
over his heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Still another miner closed in and clinched.
Segunder's fists played a terrible tattoo on the
man's body, causing the assailant to totter away
groaning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on, you dogs!&quot; bellowed the Icelander,
the spirit of battle having by this time taken
full possession of him. &quot;I lig you all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Slug him! Slug him all at once!&quot; shouted
a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can't get near enough. His arms are
too long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bang!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
Segunder received a blow in the side that
caused him to writhe with pain. He whirled
on his assailant with surprising quickness considering
the Icelander's bulk. His ponderous
fist smote the other man between the eyes, sending
the fellow hurtling clear across the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Attracted by the uproar, Bob Jarvis, who had
come in search of Olsen, had run up the stairs.
His eyes quickly took in the situation. Bob
could scarce restrain himself from rushing into
the fray. But as yet there appeared no need
for him to do so. Segunder was holding his
own; in fact, thus far he had the better of the
argument.</p>

<p class="indent">The enemy backed away and consulted for a
few brief seconds, then with one movement they
charged the big man. Men went down like
nine-pins. The long arms of the Icelander swung
wildly but with telling effect. The sound of
the blows was heard out in the street. It seldom
required more than one blow from those ponderous
fists to unfit the man on whom they had
landed for further participation in the fight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get into him! Use a club or a knife!&quot;
howled a man.</p>

<p class="indent">At this juncture Cavard, who had been watching
the progress of the fight with pale face and
blazing eyes, leaped from the platform and began
forcing his way through the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
Cavard was a big and powerful man. He
could hit hard and sure, as some of the men
there were well aware from personal experience.
Segunder saw him coming, and a gleam
of savage joy lighted up the eyes of the Icelander.</p>

<p class="indent">The Russian walked more slowly as he neared
his adversary. The two men eyed each other
steadily. All at once the labor leader's right
fist shot out with lightning-like speed. It caught
Segunder on the side of the head, spinning him
about. Before he could catch his balance
Cavard was upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly the two men became a whirling,
tumbling tangle, arms striking, feet kicking,
breath coming in quick, short gasps. First
Olsen would be under; then it would be
Cavard's turn.</p>

<p class="indent">The others in the room had instinctively
drawn back when the battle between the two
giants commenced.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard loosed his grip on Olsen, endeavoring
to get in a telling blow, with which he hoped
to put his adversary out. But before he could
strike, Segunder's fist was jammed into his face
with awful force. The labor leader staggered
back with the blood flowing freely.</p>

<p class="indent">With a growl of rage Olsen was upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">The men clinched and both went to the floor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
But, as they fell, Cavard had managed to slip
a revolver from his pocket. It was now his one
purpose to bring the weapon into position where
he could use it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look out, Segunder&mdash;he's got a gun!&quot;
shouted Bob Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">But the Icelander did not need the warning.
He had seen the movement and he was now
struggling to get possession of the weapon before
it could be turned against him. Cavard was
on his back, with his cheek pressed tightly
against the cheek of his opponent, the Icelander's
left hand pinioning Cavard's right hand and
the weapon to the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">With a sudden powerful upward movement of
his body Cavard threw his adversary off and
leaped to his feet. In getting up, however, the
Russian's weapon was knocked from his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">A lithe young figure sprang through the
crowd at the instant when the miners, believing
their leader was seriously hurt, were making a
rush for Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">The figure was Bob Jarvis. Quick as a flash
he snatched the revolver from the floor and
sprang back again the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jarvis! Jarvis! Throw him out of the
window. <i>Kill</i> the scab!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the weapon in the hand of the Iron
Boy was raised to a level with the men's heads.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;Stand back, every mother's son of you, or
I'll make you look like nutmeg graters!&quot; warned
the boy.</p>

<p class="indent">The men hesitated, then slowly fell back. They
saw that the boy meant exactly what he had
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is going to be a fair fight, and somebody
is going to get good and properly pounded.
There won't be any foul tactics as long as I've
got a grip on this revolver,&quot; Jarvis warned the
crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">The combatants were at each other with a
rush. Once more they clinched. The two desperate
men swayed from side to side, neither
seeming to be able to obtain advantage over the
other.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the Icelander's arms seemed to relax.
He pushed his adversary from him, then
with all the force in his powerful body, he concentrated
on a swift blow.</p>

<p class="indent">The blow smote the labor leader on the side
of the jaw.</p>

<p class="indent">Cavard struck the floor with terrific force.</p>

<p class="indent">With an animal-like roar the Icelander threw
himself upon the prostrate body of his antagonist.
Olsen, in his terrible rage, had lost all control
of himself. He was slow to anger, but when
once aroused he was a wild animal.</p>

<p class="indent">Gripping the other man's shoulders, he banged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
him on the hard floor with crushing force. All
at once the big, powerful fingers of the Icelander
encircled the neck of the labor leader. A look
of triumph shone in Olsen's eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segunder!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Bob Jarvis who spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segunder, stop! Stop, I tell you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the man was past heeding even if he
heard.</p>

<p class="indent">Still keeping the others covered with his
weapon, Bob Jarvis sprang forward, gripping
Olsen by the shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Segunder! Segunder!&quot; he shouted in the
ear of his friend. &quot;Stop! Stop, I tell you.
You will kill him! You've won. Let go of him,
I tell you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Icelander gazed up blankly at the boy
bending over him; then he turned once more
to his punishment of the man beneath him.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob tugged to pull him off, but he might as
well have tried to move one of the mountains of
iron on the range.</p>

<p class="indent">Something must be done, and that quickly.
Bob's mind worked with more rapidity than it
ever had worked before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hate to do so, but I've got to do it,&quot; he
muttered.</p>

<p class="indent">With that he drew back and struck Olsen two
swift blows on the side of the head. Jarvis'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
punch was no light thing. Olsen toppled from
the body of his victim and rolled over on the
floor.</p>

<p class="indent">The miners started to pounce upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stand back!&quot; shouted Bob. &quot;I'll shoot the
first man who makes a move!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen was struggling to get up. Bob was
beside him in an instant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pull Cavard away!&quot; commanded the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">No one made a move to do so. Jarvis dragged
the unconscious leader to one side, then sprang
back to Olsen, who was pulling himself together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Olsen! Segunder! I hit you. I had to do
it, or you would have killed him. Come with
me. Come <i>now</i>! You've whipped him. He
won't do any more fighting for a while, I'll
wager. Come, now&mdash;that's a good fellow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bob began tugging at the Icelander's arm.
Olsen gave ground slowly, his eyes fixed on the
figure stretched out on the floor. The boy continued
to urge the big Icelander. A happy
thought suddenly occurred to him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;"> <img class="border" src="images/iron2pic4.png" width="447" height="700" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">&quot;Come Help Me Get Rush.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come help me get Rush. I think I know
where he is. They've got him locked up somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words acted like magic on Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush, Rush, Rush?&quot; he questioned dully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes! I came for you. Come with me!&quot;
appealed Bob Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
Segunder grabbed the Iron Boy, dragging him
down the stairs two steps at a jump.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where Rush, where Rush?&quot; he demanded
savagely as they reached the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have just seen Cavard's sister. She said
Steve was to have met her at the Allison's last
night, but that she had not been able to keep
the appointment. After thinking it over, the
young woman began to think there was something
strange about the affair, and she hunted
me up at once, knowing that Steve had been
missing all day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Segunder was off, swinging into his long
stride, with Bob Jarvis running along by his
side.</p>

<p class="indent">They reached the Allison home a few minutes
later. Bob knocked, but there was no response.
He tried the door and found it locked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello, in there!&quot; shouted the lad. &quot;I believe
they are not at home. What shall we do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen knew what to do. He was not to be
deterred by a little thing like a locked door.
Backing off, he threw his whole great weight
against the offending barrier.</p>

<p class="indent">The door burst in with a loud crash.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE HERO OF THE BRIDGE</p>

<p class="indent">OLSEN leaped in through the opening,
kicking the pieces of the wrecked door
that interfered with his passage from
his path.</p>

<p class="indent">Bob darted by him. They ran into the front
room, which, in this instance, was the parlor,
but found it vacant. Next Jarvis dived into the
dining room.</p>

<p class="indent">Allison, a heavy-jowled, powerful man, was
standing at bay behind the dining-room table.
His family were nowhere in sight. The place
was squalid and poverty was in evidence everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are looking for Steve Rush. Where is
he?&quot; announced Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get out of my house! I'll have you both sent
to jail, you scoundrels!&quot; raged Allison.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you, Rush came to your house last
night, and he has not been seen since. We want
him; we want him quick! It will be the worse
for you if you don't produce him or tell us
where we shall find him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know anything about your fool
friend. I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
Bob had the miner by the throat. Allison
hurled him aside, grabbing up a chair as he did
so.</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen uttered a yell and charged the miner.
The latter made a pass at the Icelander
with the heavy dining-room chair. Segunder
wrenched it from his hands. Then he brought
the offending chair down on the floor with a
terrific crash, smashing it into kindling wood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want boy Rush!&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You get out of my house, or I'll bore you
full of holes!&quot; yelled the miner, at the same
time whipping out a knife.</p>

<p class="indent">With a well-directed kick Segunder sent the
table between them crashing to one side. With
a leap he landed upon Allison, smiting him a
powerful blow on the side of the head. Allison
went down as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen calmly stooped over, picked the fellow
up and threw him out of the window, Allison
carrying the frame and the glass with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He one bad man,&quot; grinned the Icelander.
&quot;I smash house down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen began to destroy the furniture, what
there was of it, until Jarvis restrained him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't do that, Segunder. We want to find
Steve. I believe he is here somewhere. Hark&mdash;what's
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olsen listened.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
&quot;I heard someone calling, Segunder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The voice sounded faint and far away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that you, Steve?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Down cellar. I can't get out. I think there
must be a trap somewhere, if you can find it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll find it. Olsen, he's down below us.
If we don't find the cellar opening I'll let you
try your hand at breaking a hole in the floor,&quot;
proposed Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">Both began searching for the opening. Bob
found it, but there was no ring in the trap and
Olsen solved the problem of getting the place
open by kicking a hole in the trap, then finally
demolishing it altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where's the stairs?&quot; cried Jarvis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pull stairs up,&quot; answered the Icelander.</p>

<p class="indent">Sure enough, such was the case. A short
flight of clumsily constructed stairs had been
pulled up to the floor and secured by a rope that
ran off to another part of the cellar. Upon investigation
they found that this rope led up
to another trap in the dining room, from where
the food that Steve had found must in all probability
have been lowered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
Olsen did not wait for the stairs to be lowered
but squeezed down into the hole, dropping to
the cellar bottom. Steve ran to him and the
big fellow hugged the boy delightedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I get. I smash big boss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does he mean, Bob?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He means that he gave Cavard an awful
beating. But it was a dandy fight, Steve. How
I wish you could have seen it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush heard all about the events that
had occurred since he had been taken prisoner
the night before. In turn he related what had
happened to himself. There was no direct evidence
by which they could connect Cavard with
Rush's capture, but the circumstantial evidence
was strong. Later in the day Steve went to see
the superintendent, and the two had a long talk.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing of moment occurred for several days
after that. Cavard did not appear on the street
for nearly a week after the battle, though his
lieutenants were in conference with him at his
home every day. The leader had had a beating
that he was not likely to forget during the rest
of his life. His rage was deep and murderous,
and as he paced the floor of his room he swore
vengeance on the Iron Boys as well as on
Segunder Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">An extremely cold winter was setting in. It
was developing into one of the most severe seasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
ever known on the iron range, and the suffering
of the families of the miners who were out
of work had reached a serious stage.</p>

<p class="indent">The miners themselves were growing bitter
against the bosses and more turbulent. It had
come to a point where it was not safe for a non-union
man to appear upon the street. He was in
danger of his life if he did so.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve believed that the men's turbulence was
as much due to the subtle influence of Cavard
as because of their families' sufferings. The
armed guard about the mine shafts had been
trebled, as it was feared that the strikers might
wreck some of the company's property. What
seemed to enrage the men more than ever was
the sight of the long trains of cars that were
carrying the ore from the dump pile and transferring
it to the furnaces in Ohio and in the
east. The lakes being frozen over, the ore was
conveyed all the way to the mills by rail, as is
always the case in the winter.</p>

<p class="indent">Matters were approaching a crisis, as the officials
of the mining company well realized. Mr.
Penton believed, however, that he had enough
loyal men to hold the others in check and to protect
the company's property. Steve took a different
view of the matter, but he said nothing,
as it was not fitting for him to suggest what
should and what should not be done.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
Since the boy's capture he had set himself
upon Cavard's trail with the firm purpose of
running the man down and exposing his perfidity.
He knew a weak spot would sooner or
later develop in the leader's defence, and when
it did develop Steve Rush proposed to be on
hand to break through the defence at that particular
point.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as Cavard was able to be out he began
meeting the men at the hall, encouraging them
and goading them on in his subtle way by pointing
out that the sufferings of their families were
due to the grasping avarice of the bosses. A
day or so after he got out Cavard made a trip
to the Blair, an independent mine some ten
miles up the valley. There he spent the day
and part of the night.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve did not learn of this until late in the
evening. The information caused him to wonder
what was going on up the valley. He had no
doubt that something would develop from that
visit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ought to go up there and find out what is
going on,&quot; he confided to Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot leave here. Every loyal man is
needed right here every minute of the day and
night. There is no telling at what moment
trouble will break loose, and when it comes it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
is going to come thick and fast, if I am any judge
of men. The miners are getting desperate.
They are going to break out, and with our handful
of helpers we shall be powerless to stem the
tide.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I reckon you're right. When do you think
it is coming?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is likely to occur at any minute now&mdash;to-night,
to-morrow, any time. I believe it is a
part of Cavard's game to have something like
that occur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I'd let Segunder finish the fellow
while he was about it. He would have killed
the leader in a minute more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bob, how <i>can</i> you say such a thing?&quot; chided
Rush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I suppose it is rather a strong statement,
but I don't love that man Cavard one little
bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither do I, but that is no excuse for wanting
to see him killed. We will beat him at his
own game, and with his own weapons if we can.
If not the company will have to get out of its
present situation as best it can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess that will be the answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the following day Steve set an inquiry
going in another direction, having enlisted the
services of a man whom he and Bob had sent
for from the city at their own expense. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
man belonged to a private detective agency, and
Steve had known him before coming to the
mines.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long conference, that night, at
the house of one of the loyal miners, where the
detective, Steve and Bob had gone that they
might not be observed. To have met in the
boarding house would have been to arouse suspicion,
for the strikers had spies in every place
of the sort. Cavard saw to it that he was kept
well-posted as to all that was going on.</p>

<p class="indent">The conference broke up at a late hour and
the boys made their way home through back
yards and across open lots in order to avoid
meeting with strikers. It was not that they
were afraid, but they were acting the part of
prudence. They had set out to achieve by their
own efforts what the company, with all its resources
and money, had not been able to accomplish,
and that was to break the backbone
of the strike.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a giant's task, it seemed, for two
youngsters to attempt, but the Iron Boys were
determined that it should be done.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day dawned raw and blustering. The
weather, however, did not keep the strikers
within doors. Groups were gathered on every
corner, where, while stamping about to keep
from freezing, they discussed the situation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
Shortly before noon there was a meeting at
Liberty Hall. Of course the Iron Boys were
not present.</p>

<p class="indent">When the men came away from that meeting
a change had stolen over them. They had ceased
their noisy threats. Their faces were sullen and
their words were few.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look out for trouble!&quot; nodded Steve, as he
observed the men from the window of a house
across the way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; they are loaded for bear,&quot; agreed Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something has stirred them up. Probably
Cavard has been talking to them. That man
is a fiend in human form. He handles them,
makes them his playthings, all to serve his own
selfish purposes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boys came up with Mr. Penton, who was
on his way to the mines from his office. Steve
stepped up to him, touching his hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you, boys? I have just closed down
the shafts for the rest of the day. I don't like
the looks of things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Neither do I, sir,&quot; answered Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it that you have observed?&quot; questioned
the superintendent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The men are loaded for trouble. Practically
we are standing in a drift ready to be fired, and
when the powder goes off the roof of the drift is
likely to fall down on our heads and finish us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;You are right, Rush. I have found your
advice good. What would you do to cope with
the situation, were you the superintendent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The superintendent's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would I do? Why, I'd take the situation
by the nape of the neck and shake all the
fight out of it. In the first place, if I did not
have enough men to give the strikers all the
fight they wanted, I would ask the authorities
for protection. I believe our property will be destroyed
if you don't place guards about the
mines.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to hear you say what you have
said,&quot; nodded Mr. Penton. &quot;I have urged the
sheriff to wire the governor to rush a company
of militia here, and the mining company has
backed me up in the request. I dislike to do it,
but I must protect our property. I presume it
will excite the men to violence, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The men cannot be much more excited than
they already are, sir. Cavard has worked them
up to the exploding point. With an honest man
at its head, a miner's union might be made of
real benefit to the men. It's too bad that they
have fallen into the hands of Cavard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boys went on up the street to their boarding
house to dinner. There was little conversation
at the meal, for every man felt that the
calm before the storm was upon them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
Shortly after one o'clock the men began
strolling toward the &quot;ore bridge.&quot; This was
a structure of steel and concrete that the company
had erected across a mountain gorge, and
over which the ore was carried by train to the
lakes. The ore bridge was the key to the situation.
Without it no ore could be shipped from
either the Cousin Jack or the Red Rock Mines.</p>

<p class="indent">By two o'clock there were more than a thousand
men gathered in the vicinity of the bridge.
They seemed impervious to the biting cold of
the winter's day. It was not apparent that the
men had any particular purpose in gathering
about the bridge, but there was little doubt that
their leader had put the thought in their minds
at the noonday meeting, whether or not they
realized that fact.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the men set up a cheer. Cavard,
muffled to the ears in an expensive fur coat, was
seen approaching. He was shaking hands with
the men right and left as he strolled on toward
the bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">The men began cheering. Somehow Cavard's
appearance seemed to exert a strange influence
over the miners. His sway over them was absolute.</p>

<p class="indent">They began to shout for him to talk to them.
Half a dozen men hoisted him to a stump. The
leader waved his cap.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
&quot;Men, you are making a noble fight!&quot; he
shouted. &quot;You will yet down the bosses and
make them come to your terms. We've got
them on the run already. Their feet are on
your necks and on the necks of your families,
but you will throw the weight off, and when
you do, there will be a terrible retribution. And
what a little thing stands between you and that
retribution. For instance, men, that bridge
there is the key to the ore output. That represents
the bosses. Of course we cannot interfere
with their property, but that structure of steel
and cement was made possible by the sweat of
your brows. It was you who mined the ore for
the steel from which the bridge was constructed.
It was you who made its building a possibility.
And now it rises up as if to mock you. Do not
misunderstand me; I warn you against violence,
but there are limits to man's endurance, especially
if that man have dependent upon him a
wife and children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A low murmur ran over the assemblage. The
murmur increased in volume until it became a
roar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men, men; I beg of you to be calm!&quot;
shouted Cavard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bridge! The bridge!&quot; thundered the
multitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Down with the bridge!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
&quot;Down with the bosses!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mob surged toward the structure as one
man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dynamite! Get dynamite. We'll blow it
up! We'll teach the bosses a lesson that they
won't forget!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Half a dozen men had started away on a run.
After a time, amid the clamor and the shouting,
these same six miners were seen crawling up the
ravine toward the bridge itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look! Look!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men above had seen them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They're going to dynamite the bridge!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was true. The great structure that meant
so much to the mining company seemed doomed
to destruction. The ground fairly shook with
the roar that arose when those above discovered
the purpose of their fellows. Cavard had disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a lad dashed through the mob
and out on to the bridge, running along the ties
a hundred feet in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop! Back, every man of you!&quot; he
shouted. &quot;It will be prison for years for every
man who has a hand in this affair! Call them
off! Stop them while there is still time!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get off the bridge, unless you want to be
blown to kingdom come!&quot; roared the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let him blow up! It's what he deserves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
&quot;If you destroy the bridge I shall go with
it. That will be murder. Those men down
there will be hanged for my death. Now, will
you call them off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mob hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>No!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Every man of the hundreds took up the cry.
Steve Rush stood calmly on the bridge, his attention
divided between the men creeping up
the ravine and the mob on the surface. He held
a piece of railroad iron in his hands, but this
was the only weapon he had for his own defence,
in case the men should decide to rush upon him
from the end of the structure.</p>

<p class="indent">The dynamiters were nearing the danger spot.
Just then a woman fairly flew down the short
incline that led to the bridge. She did not stop,
but dashed full speed out to the bridge. Reaching
it, she ran with all speed to where Steve
Rush was standing, exhorting the crowd and
pleading and threatening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Cavard!&quot; he gasped. &quot;You must not
stay here. Run for your life. Don't you see
what the men are going to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I'll run, but I would rather stay.
Here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thrust something toward Steve&mdash;something
that she had been carrying concealed
under her long, black coat. Steve uttered an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
exclamation of joy. It was a rifle. Passing it
quickly to him with a box of cartridges, the girl
sped on across the bridge to the opposite side.</p>

<p class="indent">None had seen the rifle change hands. Steve
waited until she had reached a place of safety;
then he stooped over and pretended to pick the
weapon up from the track. This time he made
no effort to conceal it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's got a gun!&quot; roared the miners.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and I'm going to use it,&quot; shouted the
boy. &quot;Call off your dynamiters!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurry! Fire the powder!&quot; was the answer
of the strikers.</p>

<p class="indent">Rush stepped to the edge of the bridge and
looked down. The men were attaching the fuses
to the sticks of dynamite as they ran.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve raised the rifle, took careful aim and
fired. The foremost man dropped his dangerous
burden and uttered a yell. A ball had passed
through his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Back, you hounds; or I'll riddle every man
of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once more the rifle spoke, but the bullet missed
its mark. It had the effect of stopping the man
who was trying to reach the bridge to plant the
explosive and touch off the fuse.</p>

<p class="indent">The dynamiters backed off. They had not
bargained for this. The men on the surface
made a hostile movement toward Steve, whereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
he threw the muzzle of the rifle about,
covering them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on; come on, if you want some of the
same medicine!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">Bang!</p>

<p class="indent">A yell floated up from the mountain gorge.
The Iron Boy had fired just in time to head off
another man of that little party below. Now
he kept menacing them with his weapon. Now
and then he would send a shot close to them
when he thought they were getting ready for
another charge. This continued for fully half
an hour, when the dynamiters drew back for a
consultation. A man was sent to the surface to
urge the miners to rush the bridge and throw
the boy over. But the strikers up there had no
mind to face his ready weapon at short range.
Jeers, howls and cat-calls were hurled at the
plucky boy who stood there in that wind-swept
spot a hundred feet in the air with the temperature
below zero, unmindful of taunts, but alert
and watchful.</p>

<p class="indent">Five o'clock came, and he was still there. It
was getting dark. A few minutes more and it
would be so dark that the men below would have
plenty of opportunity to carry out their desperate
plan. Steve had six cartridges left in
his magazine chamber.</p>

<p class="indent">He waited and watched. At last he could no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
longer see the bottom of the gorge. Aiming
his weapon as nearly as be could judge at the
spot where he had last seen the dynamiters, he
began shooting at intervals, varying his aim
somewhat with each shot. He hoped to hold
them off.</p>

<p class="indent">One more shell was left in the gun. Steve was
making his last stand. It would be a matter
of but a short time now before they would have
accomplished their purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly a shout rent the air. There was a
new note in it. It was not a shout of triumph,
but of anger and alarm. The boy on the bridge
did not understand it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Run for it. It's the soldiers!&quot; was the shout
that was suddenly taken up and passed from lip
to lip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurrah!&quot; shouted the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">But he had not finished yet. He turned the
rifle down into the dark gorge and pulled the
trigger again. Whether he had hit anything or
not he did not know.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look out for the soldiers!&quot; bellowed a man,
leaning over the edge of the precipice. &quot;Run
for it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steve was bounding toward the end of the
bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">The soldiers and the sheriff's deputies were
coming up at a dog trot.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
&quot;Shell the gorge down there. They're trying
to dynamite the bridge!&quot; Rush yelled.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment more and a volley of bullets from
the rifles of the guardsmen raked the depths of
the gorge with a hot fire.</p>

<p class="indent">The bridge was saved.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="h2a">CONCLUSION</p>

<p class="indent">A GREAT mob was packed in Liberty Hall
later in the evening. There were no
mutterings. The men were sullen and
discouraged. Outside the hall was a platoon
of guardsmen ready to fall in for whatever services
might be demanded of them. The spirit of
the striking men seemed to have been broken.</p>

<p class="indent">Three of the six who had gone down to plant
the dynamite under the bridge had been killed
by the fire of the guardsmen. Every shaft was
guarded by armed men, with orders to shoot
any man who approached the shaft after dark.
The company was prepared to keep the siege
up all winter if necessary, though they promised
that, were the miners to throw out their leader
and elect an honest man, the company might
treat with them, looking toward a settlement.</p>

<p class="indent">The chairman rose. His face was solemn,
but his eyes belied the solemnity of his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My friends,&quot; he began, &quot;the bosses have
triumphed over us to-day, but we shall down
them yet. I have a piece of news for you showing
the trickery to which they have resorted.
The men of the Blair Mine have gone back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
work. The bosses have done this to tantalize
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">None thought how inconsistent this was. The
men began to grow noisy and restless after this
announcement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do they go back?&quot; shouted a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the old terms,&quot; answered the chairman.
&quot;They gave it up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll keep it up! We won't give up till we
starve!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; down with the bosses! We should get
guns and drive these troops, these hirelings,
from the range. Arm yourselves, men, and assert
your manhood!&quot; cried another voice, that
of one of the leader's lieutenants, though he
made certain that only a few of those about
him observed whence the words came.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis rose from the
corner of the room near the stairway unobserved.
Steve jumped up on a window-sill, waving
his hat to attract their attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Men, men! Listen to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sullen roar when the miners discovered
who it was, and the mob rose to its
feet, surging toward Steve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stay where you are if you value your lives.
There are fifty rifles trained on this hall at this
moment. The guardsmen will riddle you with
bullets if you make a hostile move toward me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
The men hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am your friend, though you do not believe
it. I will prove to you that I am. Listen to
me, boys. Listen! That man,&quot; pointing to
Cavard, &quot;is a scoundrel. It is he who has led
you on to this terrible strike. It is he who is
to blame for the suffering of your families. I
tell you I know this. I could prove it to you,
but there are other things that you must know
first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak out. We'll hear you,&quot; cried a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to do so. Your leader has just
told you, almost shedding tears as he did so,
that the Blair Mine had resumed operations.
But there was something else that he did not
tell you. He did not tell you that he had had
a conference with the owners of the mine, and
that they had made a deal with him. Money
is what Cavard has been working for&mdash;money
and power. He's got the money now, and he
doesn't care what becomes of you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a lie!&quot; shrieked the man Cavard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the truth. Men, Cavard was paid fifteen
thousand dollars by an official of the Blair
mine last night to call off the strike. I could
give you the official's name. That fifteen thousand
dollars was deposited in the bank here
to-day. It is here, all here. I have the proofs.
He is a traitor! He has sold you out at the expense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
of your families. Now, what are you
going to do about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a howl of rage the men turned to the
place where Cavard had been standing. But
the man was gone. He had slunk out under
cover of Steve Rush's thrilling speech never to
be seen in the mining village again. Steve had
seen him go, but had not tried to detain him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall we do?&quot; cried the men, when
they discovered that their prey had escaped
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Call the strike off, here and now, and go to
work. After all has quieted down again, reorganize
your union if you wish, and put honest
men at the head of it. I shall be with you heart
and soul, if you are willing to do as I have
suggested.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rush! Rush! Three cheers for the gamest,
squarest boy on the iron range!&quot; shouted a
miner excitedly, as he sprang to a seat, waving
his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">The audience rose as one man, and the building
fairly trembled under their roars. They
rushed toward the Iron Boys. Bob was caught
in the crush and pushed half way down the stairs.
But the men were not going to leave just yet.
They were enthusiastically shouting the name
of Rush.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
Steve was caught up. His hat was lost, his
coat was nearly ripped from his shoulders, and
he was borne in triumph to the rostrum, where
they tossed him up into the president's chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're the next president of the miners'
union,&quot; they howled.</p>

<p class="indent">Steve raised a protesting hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, boys; you must choose an older man
than I. You need level heads here. Besides, I
may not be with you next year, but while I am
here I shall work for your good. Good luck,
boys! To-morrow you will go to work, and
there will be happiness in your homes on Christmas
Day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men had seated themselves again. But
as Steve finished speaking a giant figure rose up
directly in front of the platform.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Segunder Olsen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whoop! Y-e-o-w!&quot; howled the giant.</p>

<p class="indent">The strike was ended. As soon as Steve could
get away he hurried to his room and went to bed.
But his eyes were bright and his heart was full
of happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">On the following day he was summoned to the
main office of the company, with his companion.
Each lad was handed a bank book by the president,
after the latter had expressed his appreciation
of their splendid work. The bank books
showed that Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
thousand dollars apiece placed to their credit
in the bank.</p>

<p class="indent">Their work had been well done. They had
done their duty, they had risked their lives and
they had won. Their patriotism for the great
industrial cause had carried them on to a triumphant
success. Next season they were to try
themselves out in new fields, where they were
destined to distinguish themselves in a marked
manner.</p>

<p class="indent">Their further experiences will be told in a
following volume entitled, &quot;<span class="smcap">The Iron Boys on
the Ore Boats</span>; Or, Roughing it on the Great
Lakes.&quot; In that new life the lads were destined
to meet with even more thrilling experiences
than they had had during their eventful career
in the mines on the great iron range.</p>

<p class="indent">Really good and new stories for boys and girls are not
plentiful. Many stories, too, are so highly improbable as
to bring a grin of derision to the young reader's face before
he has gone far. The name of ALTEMUS is a distinctive
brand on the cover of a book, always ensuring
the buyer of having a book that is up-to-date and fine
throughout. No buyer of an ALTEMUS book is ever
disappointed.</p>

<p class="indent">Many are the claims made as to the inexpensiveness
of books. Go into any bookstore and ask for an Altemus
book. Compare the price charged you for Altemus
books with the price demanded for other juvenile books.
You will at once discover that a given outlay of money
will buy more of the ALTEMUS books than of those
published by other houses.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
